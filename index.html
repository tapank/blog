		A benefit of doing something every day is that it allows me to discover my limits, that line that I should not cross often. It is possible to push myself when performing an activity once in a while, but cannot do it every day. So, instead of 2 to 3 runs a week, I am trying out running daily (well, almost). Have cut down the daily distance but gradually, a rythm is setting in.

		[T]o advance beyond the low-hanging fruit in any meaningful discipline &ndash; from weight lifting, to writing, to meditation, to marriage &ndash; you must get comfortable spending time there. Weight lifting shoves this reality in your face since progress, or in this case, lack thereof, is so objective. Yes, you can make tweaks, some of which will prove beneficial. But none of that matters if you don’t keep showing up and pounding the stone.

		When an eCommerce company is doing well, the team is fully engaged &ndash; doing exciting things. The energy at the workplace is palpable, and most people on the team are upbeat about the future: some about the future of the business, others about the future of their own career, and some about both. There is a sense of purpose, and a sense of certainity about making progress in the right direction.

 Be flexible; some structure but not too much Do some &ldquo;loose timeboxing&rdquo;; ensure time to cover most pressing points Set expectations around what is most important; create an incentive to focus Be fully present; shift gears and get out of autopilot Make a difference in the life of this person; devote full attention Strike a balance between asking questions and listening; consider it a precious moment of connection If the conversation diverges, get it back on track Give them time and space to think about what they want to express  Meet:

 Declaring yourself to be operating by &ldquo;Crocker&rsquo;s Rules&rdquo; means that other people are allowed to optimize their messages for information, not for being nice to you. Crocker&rsquo;s Rules means that you have accepted full responsibility for the operation of your own mind - if you&rsquo;re offended, it&rsquo;s your fault. Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim to be doing you a favor. (Which, in point of fact, they would be.

		Teaching is most effective when done by a practitioner of the subject matter. That is why Bret Victor says this:
 Real teaching is not about transferring &ldquo;the material&rdquo;, as if knowledge were some sort of mass-produced commodity that ships from Amazon. Real teaching is about conveying a way of thinking. How can a teacher convey a way of thinking when he doesn&rsquo;t genuinely think that way?
 The entire blog post is worth a read &ndash; and a re-read.

 3 things:
 keep your body in shape. You get strong at the gym and thin in the kitchen get an advanced technical education, one that challenges you, at least a Master&rsquo;s degree make decisions, and stick to them. It&rsquo;s a skill that gets better with practice.

		Thought provoking analysis of the state of Agile today.
 Unfortunately, with little or no documentation, now the developer is accountable for the outcome while having little or no authority to create a winning one. This responsibility without authority makes Agile even more toxic than Waterfall.

	<div>
		After reading the following from the kernel.org coding styleguide, it is easy to see why not to write code with tabs converted to spaces, and why not to set tab width to anything less than eight.
 Tabs are 8 characters, and thus indentations are also 8 characters. There are heretic movements that try to make indentations 4 (or even 2!) characters deep, and that is akin to trying to define the value of PI to be 3.

		Author of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sorry, But Agile Won&rsquo;t Fix Your Products&rdquo; has valid points but something more needs to be said. I am concerned that the onus of creativity is being relegated away from people, as if process is capable of thinking.
It is important to note that Agile is one of many software development processes, and hence it could have been claimed that &ldquo;Processes will not fix your Products,&rdquo; and the arguments in that article would still hold good.

 Setting aside time to tend our code is essential for us to maintain fruitful software assets. Start by making technical tasks visible to your team. Prioritise these tasks so that the team works on the ones that will yield most benefit. At standup, consider as a team, what effort should be put on code tending tasks today. Keep track how much time you spend on code tending, this can help you strike the right balance against business facing features.

 Grit is a convenient trait for enticing others to comply with the uncomfortable or the uninteresting. It elevates the perseverance of such adversity to a virtue in and of itself. Just dangle that long-term goal in front of them, accuse them of lack of grit, and compliance will oft follow.

The main source of that information is from a research paper by Ericsson et.

When we look back, it is easy to tell if the balance was right but not as easy when the choice lies in front of us.

 Do you remember that first line of code you wrote when you were very young. Do you remember the thrill it gave you to see that line of code actually execute. Do you remember the feeling of power it gave you. You were the master. The machine was your slave, and you could make that machine do anything!
  Many of us became programmers because of a moment like that.
