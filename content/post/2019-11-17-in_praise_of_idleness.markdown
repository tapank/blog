> I want to say, in all seriousness, that a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by the belief in the virtuousness of work, and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work.

-- Bertrand Russell, in the essay: [In Praise of Idleness](https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/)
