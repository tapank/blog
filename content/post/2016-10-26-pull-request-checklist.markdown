Open source projects have styleguides, and [this one][1] is one such example. What caught my attention is the code review checklist, though there are other nuggets in there.

> **Checklist**

> Before you submit your patch for review, look at the diff. Consider running through a quick mental checklist of all the things discussed above before submitting your patch for review:

> - Did I write tests and update docs?
> - Can it be any clearer?
> - Can I delete more lines of code?
> - Does the diff overall look reasonable?
> - Is there any cruft like stray blank lines or debugging output or irrelevant trivial refactorings?
> - Should the change be broken into multiple meaningful pieces?
> - Is this change really necessary at all?

> (You might be surprised how often the answer to that last one is “no”.)
