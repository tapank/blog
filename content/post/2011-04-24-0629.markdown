Why time seems to pass faster as we get older

> The more detailed the memory, the longer the moment seems to last. “This
explains why we think that time speeds up when we grow older,” Eagleman
said—why childhood summers seem to go on forever, while old age slips by while
we’re dozing. The more familiar the world becomes, the less information your
brain writes down, and the more quickly time seems to pass.
