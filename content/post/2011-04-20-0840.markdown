[Scott Adams on Donald Trump](http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/donald_trump_magnificent_bastard/)

I never thought of Donald Trump this way

> Granted, many people are turned off by Trump’s pomposity. He knows that. But
he also knows that success doesn’t come from bland acceptance by the entire
world. It comes from the ability to inspire the few. He’s nailing that part. I
just spent my morning writing about him.
