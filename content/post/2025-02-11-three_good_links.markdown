1. [Team Topologies â€“ Book Review][1]: Dave Farley reviews the book
   "Team Topologies" by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais.  This book adds
   something important to our discipline: it defines an approach to
   using organizational structure as a tool to achieve better results in
   software. 

2. [What it Means to be an Engineering Manager][2]: These reflections
   offer one view into the realities and challenges of engineering
   management, and may serve as a guide to those on a similar path.

3. [DeepSeek-R1: Do we need less compute now?][3]: There is no
   simplistic argument that faster algorithms and implementations
   necessarily lead to lower spend on computing hardware.  History shows
   that sometimes this is not true at all.
