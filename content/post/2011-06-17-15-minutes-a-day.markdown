Getting started on something new can be challenging. While it is surprising, it is true, that one would find it difficult to get started on a project of their own choosing. Typical examples of new projects are: exercise, new business, new job, new skill, quitting a bad habit, etc. Why would it be difficult to embark upon a journey that you actually want to begin? The strongest reasons are the fear of unknown, and the fear of failure.

15 minutes a day method helps overcome the inertia and helps one get over the hump. Simple rules to follow:

* Spend 15 minutes every day on your new project
* During this phase, avoid rating your experience of performing that activity
* Do not miss a single day
* Even if you start enjoying your new project/activity a lot, resist the temptation of going beyond 15 minutes

It takes [21 days](http://karecha.com/2009/02/14/forming-a-habit-in-21-days/) to form a habit. In those 21 days, follow this rule of 15 minutes a day and get over that hump.
