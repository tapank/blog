**Setup:**

- Block regular time; tune frequency for individual
- Show up on time; donâ€™t cancel at the last minute
- Prepare discussion points; ask him/her to do the same

**Remember:**

- Be flexible; some structure but not too much
- Do some "loose timeboxing"; ensure time to cover most pressing points
- Set expectations around what is most important; create an incentive to focus
- Be fully present; shift gears and get out of autopilot
- Make a difference in the life of this person; devote full attention
- Strike a balance between asking questions and listening; consider it a precious moment of connection
- If the conversation diverges, get it back on track
- Give them time and space to think about what they want to express

**Meet:**

- Start positive by sharing a win
- Ask direct but open-ended questions about goals
- Ask questions about career plans; do not neglect the personal
- Ask strategic questions (e.g. are we focused on the right things?)
- End with a note of appreciation and gratitude; words of affirmation mean a lot
