1. [Remote Development at Slack][1]: Slack's developer productivity team moved the entire development experience to remote environments, from code intelligence to type-checking and builds. Engineers no longer have to maintain code or dependencies on their local laptops. They can get a fresh isolated environment on demand, ready to be used within a couple of minutes.

2. [Monitoring tiny web services][2]: If you run a small but business critical website, this post is for you. Monitor your services with bare minimum cost and effort.

3. [Lies My Parents Told Me (About Logs)][3]: Any time there are changes in your scale or maturity or environment, you may need to reconsider your assumptions about logs, and these are good enough place to start.
