Rachel Davies in a blog post titled [Making Time To Tend Code][1]

>Setting aside time to tend our code is essential for us to maintain fruitful software assets. Start by making technical tasks visible to your team. Prioritise these tasks so that the team works on the ones that will yield most benefit. At standup, consider as a team, what effort should be put on code tending tasks today. Keep track how much time you spend on code tending, this can help you strike the right balance against business facing features. Reflect together as a team on how code tending is going.
