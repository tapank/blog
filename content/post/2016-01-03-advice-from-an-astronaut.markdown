To the [question][2]: "What advice would you give a 13-year-old who wishes to become an astronaut in the future?", the astronaut [Chris Hadfield][1] answered:

> 3 things:
> 
> 1. keep your body in shape. You get strong at the gym and thin in the kitchen
> 2. get an advanced technical education, one that challenges you, at least a Master's degree
> 3. make decisions, and stick to them. It's a skill that gets better with practice.
