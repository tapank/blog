> I have a theory that the rational side of your brain is only as strong as
your language skills. You assume that a person who is logical can, as a result
of that logical facility, write a clear and persuasive sentence. But I think
causation works the other way. I think language creates logic. The stronger
your language skills are, the better your logic becomes. You can never be more
rational than your vocabulary allows.
