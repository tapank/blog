> Untutored minds are very prone to mistake inferences for observations, and
prepossessions for facts; their observations and their judgments are alike
vitiated by dogma and prejudice; they do not seek to investigate, they seek to
prove.  The old proverb is inverted, believing is seeing. The student of
science must pledge himself to do his best to eliminate prepossession and dogma
from his judgments, and he must spare no pains to acquire the habit of
recording phenomena as they are observed; and to distinguish sharply between
what is or has been actually seen, and what is mentally supplied. It requires a
mind disciplined like a soldier to avoid the natural inclination to look away
from unwelcome facts.

-- Frederick Ludwig Hoffman
