1. [Pressure to Merge][1]: How often does the team discard a set of
   changes and go on to solve the problem a different way because of the
   discussion in the code review?  The answer should be more often than
   "never" and less often than "usually".

2. [Emerging Patterns in Building GenAI Products][2]: As we move
   software products using generative AI technology from
   proof-of-concepts into production systems, we are uncovering a range
   of common patterns.

3. [Subjectivity in productivity][3]: Precision. Certainty. Specificity.
   Everyone wants to know exactly what and exactly when, and they want a
   statistic attached to corroborate it.  But numbers are rarely answers
   â€” just as projects are rarely math problems.
