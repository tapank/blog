One thing that keeps us going more than anything else is -- the hope that tomorrow is going to be better than today. This is true no matter what your today looks like. You may be going through the worst day of your life or today may be the best day of your life, but tomorrow needs to be something you look forward to. For example, [former Olympians struggle](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/14/london-athletes-face-post-olympic-blues.html) with post Olympic stress disorder because their best days seem to be behind them.

Give yourself something to look forward to. That is what keeps us going.
