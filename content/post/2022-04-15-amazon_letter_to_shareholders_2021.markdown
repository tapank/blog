Amazon's new CEO Andy Jassy's [2021 letter to the shareholders][1] just came out and is packed with information about Amazon's successes as well as the challenges they faced last year. What I found interesting is buried deep -- components that are helping Amazon succeed. Here is the condensed list (read the letter for details):

- Hire the Right Builders ("people who like to invent, who look at customer experiences, dissect what doesn't work well about them, and seek to reinvent them")
- Organize Builders into Teams That Are as Separable and Autonomous as Possible ("single-threaded teams will know their customers' needs better")
- Give Teams the Right Tools and Permission to Move Fast
- You Need Blind Faith, But No False Hope ("feedback loops" and "product development process of working backwards from the customer")
- Define a Minimum Loveable Product (MLP), and Be Willing to Iterate Fast ("figuring out where to draw the line for launch")
- Adopt a Long-term Orientation ("you have to be in it for the long-haul or you'll give up too quickly")
- Brace Yourself for Failure ("if you invent a lot, you will fail more often than you wish")
