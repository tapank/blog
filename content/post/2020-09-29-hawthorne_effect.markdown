> Loosely stated, [Hawthorne Effect][1] says that people perform better when they're trying something new. Change itself isn't as important as the act of changing. People are charmed by differentness, they like the attention, they are intrigued by novelty. A careful study of the literature of productivity improvement could convince you that all productivity improvements are due to the Hawthorne Effect. To allow this effect to work for you, you have to make nonstandard approaches the rule. Whatever standard there is should be brief and gentle. The total of all standards imposed upon people should be described in no more than ten pages. Be prepared to grant exceptions to even this loose guide.
