1. [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years][1]: This timeless blog post
   by Peter Norvig will continue to inspire software developers for
   years to come. It translates well to any skill because the foundation
   of effective learning is built upon the bedrock of being genuinely
   interested in that skill and pursuing it because it's fun.

2. [Being a Technical Lead][2]: New Technical Leaders have to quickly
   learn some management skills, on the job, probably with no training
   other than their previous experiences of see the impact that their
   technical leaders had for good and bad.

3. [What does a Build Tool do?][3]: What does a build tool even do? This
   blog post explores what build tools are all about, why they are
   important to most software projects as they scale, and how they work
   under the hood.
