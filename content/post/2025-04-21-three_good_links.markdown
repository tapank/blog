1. [Move Slow and Fix Things][1]: The author argues that moving slowly
   doesn't mean you can't make quick decisions. It's just that the
   execution should be deliberate. Don't wreak havoc along the way.
   Because the time to fix what you might break rarely comes.

2. [The Best Programmers I Know][2]: The author lists some important
   traits of effective programmers.  For example, he says, the best keep
   digging until they find the reason. They might not find the reason
   immediately, they might never find it, but they never blame external
   circumstances.  With this attitude, they are able to make incredible
   progress and learn things that others fail to.

3. [Senior Developer Skills in the AI Age][3]: Senior software engineers
   are in the perfect position to ensure success with Coding Assistants,
   because the very experience and accumulated know-how in software
   engineering and project management best practices, which only seem
   obsolete in the age of AI, are precisely what enable the most
   effective use of these tools.
