A life lesson I learned last year is by watching others go about doing their jobs. It is about effectiveness -- and striking a balance between short term and longer term effectiveness. The lesson is: do not give up long term effectiveness in favor of short term efficiencies.

When we look back, it is easy to tell if the balance was right but not as easy when the choice lies in front of us. In such situations, leaning towards long term effectiveness makes it more likely that we will be comfortable with our choices of the past.
