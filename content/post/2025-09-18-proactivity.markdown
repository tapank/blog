In [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People][seven_habits], the first
habit from the group "Private Victory" is "Be Proactive."  Covey defines
proactivity so well that the answer to the question of how to be
proactive is almost self evident.

> By nature, humans are proactive.  If our lives are a function of
> conditioning and conditions, it is because we have, by conscious
> decision or by default, chosen to empower those things to control us.
> In making such a choice, we become reactive.  

> Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment.  If
> the weather is good, they feel good.  If it isn't, it affects their
> attitude and their performance.  Proactive people can carry their own
> weather with them.  Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to
> them.  They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good
> quality work, it isn't a function of whether the weather is conducive
> to it or not.

> Reactive people are also affected by their social environment, by the
> "social weather."  When people treat them well, they feel well; when
> people don't, they become defensive or protective.  Reactive people
> build their emotional lives around the behavior of others, empowering
> the weaknesses of other people to control them.

> The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the
> proactive person.  Reactive people are driven by feelings, by
> circumstances, by conditions, by their environment.  Proactive people
> are driven by valuesâ€”carefully thought about, selected and
> internalized values.

> Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether
> physical, social, or psychological.  But their response to the
> stimuli, conscious or unconscious, is a value-based choice or
> response.
