What a year 2013 has been. I quit my job at the company that I worked at for 13 years. Here -- with my current employer -- I have learned a lot in these ten months. I have seen what I think makes a technology company successful. I have met people who I think are very smart. I have also seen what I think makes smart people make choices that may not be aligned with the grain of a company's culture. I have seen two bosses at this company in this short span of time. I have seen a lot more...

This is just the beginning. It feels like I will see much more here than what I can imagine. But hey, that's why I am here.

I have plans for 2014. I don't know where I will be at the end of the year, but its going to be a ride to remember. People ask what's the big deal about new year -- its just an artificial event. I don't think so. Because if I do, the year will be just like that -- one more year of boredom and routine.

If you have not made a solid plan for this new year, now is the time to do so. Just let your imagination run wild, and think of what you want to achieve by the end of the year. You will be surprised to see your plans and dreams come true. Just be sure what you ask is what you actually want, because there will be no going back.

Happy new year!
