A benefit of doing something every day is that it allows me to discover my limits, that line that I should not cross often. It is possible to push myself when performing an activity once in a while, but cannot do it every day. So, instead of 2 to 3 runs a week, I am trying out running daily (well, almost). Have cut down the daily distance but gradually, a rythm is setting in. Afterall, a run streak is not bad.
