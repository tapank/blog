Joel Spolsky blogs about software development and points out wasteful inventories.

In the post, he makes an interesting observation about feature backlog:

> Every product attracts new feature ideas, and you canâ€™t implement ideas as fast as you can think them up, so you write them down, and this list is called the feature backlog. A lot of the ideas on the backlog are bad ideas, and you merely wrote them down to avoid hurting the feelings of the people who thought them up. Backlogs make everyone feel good.
