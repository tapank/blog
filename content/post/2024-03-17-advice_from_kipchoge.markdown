[Eliud Kipchoge][wiki], one of the running greats, shared the following advice with
runners and others, on a podcast. Below, I present some of that guidance,
rephrased in my own language.

- When you achieve something, celebrate. But soon start focusing on the next goal.
- Instead of focusing on success, focus on training and planning which can
  bring success.
- Do not sit and wait for success.
- Success is proof of your mastery over what you are doing. But you need a
  system.
- Define success in your own view.
- Running is life.
- Life is about movement.
- Reflect daily on whether you influenced the world positively or
  negatively.
- Pain is part of success. Learn to enjoy pain.
- Run daily, and do resistance training 3 days a week.
- A lot of endurance training keeps injuries at bay.
- Self discipline means sacrificing passions and pleasures in order to work
  on your career.
- No human is limited.
- Believe it first before you can do it.
- Success is a process. It's mantra is:
  1. Say no a lot.
  2. Set your priorities right.
  3. Avoid complaining.
