Harvard's popular CS50 and related courses (CS50X, CS50G, etc.) are a gift to the world (they are all free!) which we do not appreciate enough. One of these courses starts soon and is called CS50P -- CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python. The course is relevant if you belong to one of the following categories:

- A nonprogrammer who wants to learn to program (not necessarily as a career choice but just to improve your effectiveness in your current job, or as a hobby)
- A programmer who wants to learn Python (it is the most popular language in the industry today!)
- A Python programmer who just wants to brush up on the fundamentals
- A parent of a middle or high schooler (this will be an opportunity for your child to dabble in programming; what better way to spend the summer holidays!)

Find the course [here][1].

Also, check out the [other CS50 courses][2]. You might find something which is even more relevant to your ambitions or your current work.
