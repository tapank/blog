The writing on the wall is clear

> It doesn’t matter if you go running every morning, or you’re a regular at
the gym. If you spend most of the rest of the day sitting — in your car, your
office chair, on your sofa at home — you are putting yourself at increased
risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, a variety of cancers and an early
death. In other words, irrespective of whether you exercise vigorously,
sitting for long periods is bad for you.
