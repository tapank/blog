[Andrej Karpathy][0] recently gave a keynote at AI Startup School in San
Francisco and he called it "[Software Is Changing (Again)][1]".  He laid
down the current state of AI/LLM assisted programming, and where it is
going.

Software development has evolved in these steps:

1. Software 1.0: code written by humans (started mid of last century)
2. Software 2.0: programming neural nets with weights (started a couple of decades ago?)
3. Software 3.0: programming LLMs with prompts (started a couple of years ago)

Karpathy advises anybody who is entering the field now to be good at all
of the above.  A good reminder for newcomers that 1.0 cannot be skipped
in spite of the current hype about AI which will make you believe that
learning to code is no longer necessary.

One other interesting tidbit is a new convention of adding llms.txt
along side your web documentation of whatever web services your company
offers, in order to enable coding agents.  For example, Stripe
documentation has an llms.txt at [https://docs.stripe.com/llms.txt][2]

The keynote is worth watching.
