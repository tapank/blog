# How to Live on Twenty-Four Hours a Day
Author: [Arnold Bennett][arnoldbennett]  
Reviewed on: 07 September 2024

This one is more of my book reading notes than a review.  I hope these notes
will rouse enough curiosity in you to actually go read the book.
- Majority of the men put not as much but as little of themselves as they
  conscientiously can into the earning of a livelihood, and that their vocation
  bores rather than interests them.
- It is always the man who has tasted life who demands more of it.  And it is
  always the man who never gets out of bed who is the most difficult to rouse.
- A man's powers ought not to be monopolized by his ordinary day's work.  What,
  then, is to be done?
- Sleep is partly a matter of habit — and of slackness.  The author is convinced
  that most people sleep as long as they do because they are at a loss for any
  other diversion.
- Time is the inexplicable raw material of everything.  With it, all is
  possible; without it, nothing.
- Money is far more commoner than time.  The supply of time, though gloriously
  regular, is cruelly restricted.
- We are haunted by the feeling that the years slip by, and slip by, and slip
  by, and that we have not yet been able to get our lives into proper working
  order.  That feeling of uneasiness, of expectation, of looking forward, of
  aspiration.  It is a source of constant discomfort, for it behaves like a
  skeleton at the fest of all our enjoyments.
- You never will have "more time," since you already have all the time there is.
- The most important preliminary to the task of arranging one's life so that one
  may live fully and comfortably within one's budget of twenty-four hours is the
  calm realization of the extreme difficulty of the task, of the sacrifices and
  the endless effort which it demands.
- If you will not be content with a small result for a big effort, then do not
  begin.
- There is no magic method of beginning.  If a man standing on the edge of a
  swimming-bath and wanting to jump into the cold water should ask you, "How do
  I begin to jump?" you would merely reply, "Just jump.  Take hold of your
  nerves, and jump."
- The beauty about the constant supply of time is that you cannot waste it in
  advance.
- You may fancy that the water will be warmer next week.  It won't.  It will be
  colder.
- Let me principally warn you against your own ardor.  Ardor in well-doing is a
  misleading and a treacherous thing.  It cries out loudly for employment; you
  can't satisfy it at first; it wants more and more; it is eager to move
  mountains and divert the course of rivers.  It isn't content till it
  perspires.  And then, too often, when it feels the perspiration on its brow,
  it wearies all of a sudden and dies, without even putting itself to the
  trouble of saying, "I've had enough of this."
- Beware of undertaking too much at the start.  Be content with quite a little.
  Allow for accidents.  Allow for human nature, especially your own.
- Just as nothing succeeds like success, so nothing fails like failure.  Most
  people who are ruined are ruined by attempting too much.  A glorious failure
  leads to nothing; a petty success may lead to a success that is not petty.
- The great and profound mistake which a typical man makes in regard to his day
  is a mistake of general attitude, a mistake which vitiates and weakens
  two-thirds of his energies and interests.  In the majority of instances he
  does not precisely feel a passion for his business; at best he does not
  dislike it.  He begins his business functions with reluctance, as late as he
  can, and he ends them with joy, as early as he can.  And his engines while he
  is engaged in his business are seldom at their full "h.p."  Yet in spite of
  all this he persists in looking upon those hours from ten to six as "the day,"
  to which the ten hours preceding them and the six hours following them are
  nothing but a prologue and epilogue.  Such an attitude, unconscious though it
  be, of course kills his interest in the odd sixteen hours, with the result
  that, even if he does not waste them, he does not count them; he regards them
  simply as margin.  This general attitude is utterly illogical and unhealthy,
  since it formally gives the central prominence to a patch of time and a bunch
  of activities which the man's one idea is to "get through" and have "done
  with."  If a man makes two-thirds of his existence subservient to one-third,
  for which admittedly he has no absolutely feverish zest, how can he hope to
  live fully and completely?  He cannot.
- One of the chief things which a typical man has to learn is that the mental
  faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an
  arm or a leg.  All they want is change—not rest, except in sleep.
- Newspapers are produced with rapidity, to be read with rapidity.  There is no
  place in my daily program for newspapers.  I read them as I may in odd
  moments.  But I do read them.  The idea of devoting to them thirty or forty
  consecutive minutes of time is to me repugnant.  I cannot possibly allow you
  to scatter priceless pearls of time with such Oriental lavishness.  You are
  not the Shah of time.  Let me respectfully remind you that you have no more
  time than I have.
- I suggest that at six o'clock (after work), you look facts in the face and
  admit that you are not tired (because you are not, you know), and that you
  arrange your evening so that it is not cut in the middle by a meal.  By so
  doing you will have a clear expanse of at least three hours.  Employ them in
  some important and consecutive cultivation of the mind. 
- The man who begins to go to bed forty minutes before he opens his bedroom
  door is bored; that is to say, he is not living.
- Habits are the very dickens to change!  Any change, even a change for the
  better, is always accompanied by drawbacks and discomforts.  If you imagine
  that you will be able to devote a few hours a day to serious, continuous
  effort, and still live your old life, you are mistaken.  I repeat that some
  sacrifice, and an immense deal of volition, will be necessary.  And it is
  because I know the difficulty, it is because I know the almost disastrous
  effect of failure in such an enterprise, that I earnestly advise a very humble
  beginning.  You must safeguard your self-respect.  Self-respect is at the root
  of all purposefulness, and a failure in an enterprise deliberately planned
  deals a desperate wound at one's self-respect.  Hence I iterate and reiterate:
  Start quietly, unostentatiously.
- When you have conscientiously given seven hours and a half a week to the
  cultivation of your vitality for three months—then you may begin to sing
  louder and tell yourself what wondrous things you are capable of doing.
- Before coming to the method of using the indicated hours, I have one final
  suggestion to make.  That is, as regards the evenings, to allow much more than
  an hour and a half in which to do the work of an hour and a half.  Remember
  the chance of accidents.  Remember human nature.  And give yourself, say, from
  9 to 11.30 for your task of ninety minutes.
- People complain of the lack of power to concentrate, not witting that they may
  acquire the power, if they choose.  Without the power to concentrate—that is
  to say, without the power to dictate to the brain its task and to ensure
  obedience—true life is impossible.  Mind control is the first element of a
  full existence.
- Why not devote a little attention to the far more delicate machinery of the
  mind, especially as you will require no extraneous aid?  It is for this
  portion of the art and craft of living that I have reserved the time of the
  morning run. 
- I do not care what you concentrate on, so long as you concentrate.  It is the
  mere disciplining of the thinking machine that counts.  But still, you may as
  well kill two birds with one stone, and concentrate on something useful.  I
  suggest — it is only a suggestion — a little chapter of Marcus Aurelius or
  Epictetus, Bhagwat Geeta, or Patanjali Yog Sutra.
- I am entirely convinced that what is more than anything else lacking in the
  life of the average well-intentioned man of today is the reflective mood.  We
  do not reflect.  I mean that we do not reflect upon genuinely important
  things; upon the problem of our happiness, upon the main direction in which we
  are going, upon what life is giving to us, upon the share which reason has (or
  has not) in determining our actions, and upon the relation between our
  principles and our conduct.
- The chances are that you have already come to believe that happiness is
  unattainable.  But men have attained it.  And they have attained it by
  realizing that happiness does not spring from the procuring of physical or
  mental pleasure, but from the development of reason and the adjustment of
  conduct to principles.
- The solitude of the evening walk can be used to reflect upon the day's living.
  This is the time of a steady looking at one's self in the face (disconcerting
  though the sight may be).  A reflective mood naturally follows the exertion of
  having earned the day's living.
- Nothing is humdrum.  The study of cause and effect, while it lessens the
  painfulness of life, adds to life's picturesqueness.  The man to whom
  evolution is but a name looks at the sea as a grandiose, monotonous spectacle,
  which he can witness in August for three shillings third-class return.  The
  man who is imbued with the idea of development, of continuous cause and
  effect, perceives in the sea an element which in the day-before-yesterday of
  geology was vapor, which yesterday was boiling, and which tomorrow will
  inevitably be ice.  Nothing will afford a more durable satisfaction than the
  constantly cultivated appreciation of this.  It is the end of all science.
- In the cultivation of the mind one of the most important factors is precisely
  the feeling of strain, of difficulty, of a task which one part of you is
  anxious to achieve and another part of you is anxious to shirk; and that
  feeling cannot be got in facing an easy task such as reading a novel.
- I suggest no particular work as a start.  But I have two general suggestions
  of a certain importance.  The first is to define the direction and scope of
  your efforts.  Choose a limited period, or a limited subject, or a single
  author.  Say to yourself: "I will know something about the French Revolution,
  or the rise of railways, or the works of John Keats." And during a given
  period, to be settled beforehand, confine yourself to your choice.  There is
  much pleasure to be derived from being a specialist.
- The second suggestion is to think as well as to read.  I know people who read
  and read, and for all the good it does them they might just as well cut
  bread-and-butter.  They take to reading as better men take to drink.  They fly
  through the shires of literature on a motor-car, their sole object being
  motion.  They will tell you how many books they have read in a year.  Unless
  you give at least forty-five minutes to careful, fatiguing reflection (it is
  an awful bore at first) upon what you are reading, your ninety minutes of a
  night are chiefly wasted.  This means that your pace will be slow.  Never
  mind.  Forget the goal; think only of the surrounding country; and after a
  period, perhaps when you least expect it, you will suddenly find yourself in a
  lovely town on a hill.
- When one sets forth on the enterprise of using all one's time, it is just as
  well to remember that one's own time, and not other people's time, is the
  material with which one has to deal; that the earth rolled on pretty
  comfortably before one began to balance a budget of the hours, and that it
  will continue to roll on pretty comfortably whether or not one succeeds in
  one's new role of chancellor of the exchequer of time.  It is as well not to
  chatter too much about what one is doing, and not to betray a too-pained
  sadness at the spectacle of a whole world deliberately wasting so many hours
  out of every day, and therefore never really living.  It will be found,
  ultimately, that in taking care of one's self one has quite all one can do.
- Another danger is the danger of being tied to a program like a slave to a
  chariot.  One's program must not be allowed to run away with one.  It must be
  respected, but it must not be worshiped as a fetish.  A program of daily
  employ is not a religion.
- And still another danger is the danger of developing a policy of rush, of
  being gradually more and more obsessed by what one has to do next.  In this
  way one may come to exist as in a prison, and one's life may cease to be one's
  own.  One may take the dog out for a walk at eight o'clock, and meditate the
  whole time on the fact that one must begin to read at a quarter to nine, and
  that one must not be late.
- And the occasional deliberate breaking of one's program will not help to mend
  matters.  The evil springs not from persisting without elasticity in what one
  has attempted, but from originally attempting too much, from filling one's
  program till it runs over.  The only cure is to reconstitute the program, and
  to attempt less.
- If the program exhibits a tendency to be oppressive, and yet one wishes not to
  modify it, an excellent palliative is to pass with exaggerated deliberation
  from one portion of it to another; for example, to spend five minutes in
  perfect mental quiescence between chaining up the St.  Bernard and opening the
  book; in other words, to waste five minutes with the entire consciousness of
  wasting them.
- The last, and chiefest danger is the risk of a failure at the commencement of
  the enterprise.  A failure at the commencement may easily kill outright the
  newborn impulse towards a complete vitality, and therefore every precaution
  should be observed to avoid it.  The impulse must not be over-taxed.  Let the
  pace of the first lap be even absurdly slow, but let it be as regular as
  possible.  Having once decided to achieve a certain task, achieve it at all
  costs of tedium and distaste.  The gain in self-confidence of having
  accomplished a tiresome labor is immense.
- Finally, in choosing the first occupations of those evening hours, be guided
  by nothing whatever but your taste and natural inclination.  It is a fine
  thing to be a walking encyclopedia of philosophy, but if you happen to have no
  liking for philosophy, and to have a like for the natural history of
  street-cries, much better leave philosophy alone, and take to street-cries.

## Habit
Author: [William James][williamjames]  
Reviewed on: 05 March 2024

William James was a philosopher who has written many books and essays.
Habit is one of his essays and is available as a book which can be download
for free from Google Books or archive.org since the copyright is expired.
The book was written more than 100 years ago and is short and stays on
point.  The author talks about his mental model about habit — how it is
formed, why is it difficult to form or break one, etc. He also explains why
habits are more physical than just psychological in the sense that they are
like grooves that guide our behavior subconsciously and this is what makes
it hard to change them.

The best part of the book is that it does not beat around the bush and gets
to the point right from the first sentence, which is: "When we look at
living creatures from an outward point of view, one of the first things
that strike us is that they are bundles of habits."

## Principles
Author: [Ray Dalio][raydalio]  
Reviewed on: 05 March 2024

In a nutshell, I abandoned readying this book after a couple of chapters.

I started reading this book and could not go past the first couple of
chapters. I tried to pick it up again, but could not continue. Since I have
heard good things about this book, I was expecting it to be gripping, but
the style is not to my taste. It contains too many of personal anecdotes
for the book to be useful, at least to me.

## The 12 Week Year
### Get More Done in 12 Weeks Than Others Do in 12 Months
Authors:  Brian P. Moran, Michael Lennington  
Reviewed on: 06 February 2024

In this book, the authors teach a method that they claim has helped
companies, business people, sports people and others achieve great heights.
At the core, this book is about compressing a year into 12 weeks, which
allows us to accomplish in 3 months what we think is achievable in a year.
And, the chances of success is higher than the typical one year thinking.
Each day should be thought of as a compressed week, which is a mental trick
to help us stay on plan. The system is layered and at the bottom is the
long term vision. This is arrived at after deep contemplation and
visualization of the desired future. Next is the 3 year vision which is
based on the long term vision, and finally, the 12 week plan which is based
on the 3 year vision.  The vision helps us pull through patches of low
motivation. The system includes 3 principles and 5 tactics, as follows:

**Principles**

- Accountability: A willingness to own actions and results, regardless of
  circumstances
- Commitment: A personal promise that you make to yourself
- Greatness in the Moment: Each moment that you choose to do the things
  that you need to do to be great

**Tactics**

- Vision: A clear picture of the future
- Planning: Actions needed to achieve the vision
- Process Control: Align daily actions with your plan
- Measurement: Lead and lag indicators that provide feedback
- Time Use: Using your time with clear intention

I think this system should work better than simply relying on motivation to
accomplish goals.

## Ultralearning
### Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate your career
Author: Scott H. Young  
Reviewed on: 21 January 2024

The author never went to MIT but wanted to learn the CS curriculum of MIT
and took up the challenge of teaching himself the entire course in one
year, and successfully completed it. He also learned new languages like
French and South Korean in three months each and was able to comfortably
talk to native speakers of these languages. This book is about developing
the ability to learn hard things in a short span of time. Since projects
can be vastly different, the author argues that the best way to learn
ultralearning is to internalize a set of guiding principles (and not a set
of fixed steps), and those are:

- Metalearing: first draw a map
- Focus: sharpen your knife
- Directness: go straight ahead
- Drill: attack your weakest point
- Retrieval: Test to learn
- Feedback: Don't dodge the punches
- Retention: Don't fill a leaky bucket
- Intuition: Dig deep before building up
- Experimentation: Explore outside your comfort zone

Once these principles are internalized, one can pick up a project of their
choice, whether it is learning a new programming language, learning
carpentry, learning to play chess etc. and learn that skill in a short
time. This can be done at work to learn new skills or outside of work for
hobbies. Useful for students and professionals alike. I read the book
quickly in two days, and will now give it another pass at a slow and
deliberate speed.

## The Courage to Be Disliked
### How to Free Yourself, Change your Life and Achieve Real Happiness
Authors: Ichiro Kishimi & Fumitake Koga  
Reviewed on: 16 January 2024

The Courage to Be Disliked is about unlocking the power within yourself to
be the person you truly want to be. It is based on the theories of [Alfred
Adler][adler]'s Individual Psychology and is written as a conversation
between a philosopher and a young man. While reading this book, I was
constantly reminded of Bhagwad Geeta's message about removing attachment.
The book is written at a level that would work well for people in the late
teens as well as for adults of any age. The lessons can be summarized as
follows:

- No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have
  no bearing at all on how you live from now on.
- All problems are interpersonal relationship problems.
- It's not what one is born with but what use one makes of that equipment.
- Deny the desire for recognition. It makes you unfree.
- Do not live to satisfy the expectations of others.
- Do not intervene in other people's tasks and do not allow other people to
  intervene in your tasks.
- You are not the center of the world.
- Listen to the voice of the larger community. We belong to the community
  of universe.
- Do not rebuke or praise. Encourage.
- Remain in the present. Here and now.
- Excessive self-consciousness stifles the self. Don't affirm, but accept
  the self. Have confidence in others.
- If one has a feeling of contribution, one will no longer have any need for
  recognition from others.
- Community feeling: engage in self-acceptance, confidence in others, and
  contribution to others.
- Possess the courage to be normal, and your looking at the world will
  change dramatically.
- To shine a spotlight on here and now is to go about doing what one can do
  now, earnestly and conscientiously.

The above bullet points are cherry picked from the book in the hope that
going through these points will help me recall the message of the book. But
I realize that this is not a one-read book and needs to be read again and
again in order to internalize the message.

## Caffeine Blues
### Waking up to the hidden dangers of America's #1 drug
Author: Stephen Cherniske  
Reviewed: 6 January 2024

Over the years, I would stumble upon claims that caffeine and/or coffee
have downsides which are underplayed by the media because of all the
marketing money the interested corporations throw at spinning positive
research about the benefits of coffee/caffeine. However, as some of those
claims started to resonate with my personal experience, I wanted to learn
more. I ended up reading this book because many coffee quitters pointed at
this book as a good place to get all the information. The book is a good
read and it deals with multiple aspects of caffeine harm from personal to
political and environmental. This book convinced me to finally quit coffee,
and the following summary of the book is what helped me make this call:

- Caffeine can't provide energy, only chemical stimulation, an induced
  emergency state that can lead to irritability, mood swings, and panic
  attacks.
- Caffeine's ultimate mood effect can be letdown, which can lead to
  depression and chronic fatigue.
- Caffeine gives the illusion of heightened alertness by dilating pupils,
  quickening heart rate, and raising blood pressure. In fact caffeine does
  not increase overall mental activity.

## Play Anything
### The Pleasure of Limits, the Uses of Boredom, and the Secret of Games
Author: Ian Bogost  
Reviewed: 3 January 2024

This book is about developing an attitude of play in anything we do. The
goal is to make our tasks and projects more engaging and fun, i.e. more
fulfilling and rewarding as opposed to being pleasurable. The following
two quotes from the book capture the message quite well.

> Misery gives way to fun when you take an object , event, situation, or
> scenario that wasn't designed for you, that isn't concerned in the
> slightest for your experience of it, and then _treat it as if it were_.

And...

> It is more productive to work with objects, people, and situations we
> encounter by using, understanding, and appreciating them for what they
> are rather than for how they make us feel about ourselves.

It became harder to proceed with the book after a couple of chapters, and
the reviews on Goodreads echo this too. I eventually skimmed through the
rest of the book and called it done. However, the core message is really
compelling and worth adopting in terms of our general attitude towards
things.
