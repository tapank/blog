## Play Anything: The Pleasure of Limits, the Uses of Boredom, and the Secret of Games
Author: Ian Bogost  
Reviewed: 3 January 2024

This book is about developing an attitude of play in anything we do. The
goal is to make our tasks and projects more engaging and fun, i.e. more
fulfilling and rewarding as opposed to being pleasurable. The following
two quotes from the book capture the message quite well.

> Misery gives way to fun when you take an object , event, situation, or
> scenario that wasn't designed for you, that isn't concerned in the
> slightest for your experience of it, and then _treat it as if it were_.

And...

> It is more productive to work with objects, people, and situations we
> encounter by using, understanding, and appreciating them for what they
> are rather than for how they make us feel about ourselves.

It became harder to proceed with the book after a couple of chapters, and
the reviews on Goodreads echo this too. I eventually skimmed through the
rest of the book and called it done. However, the core message is really
compelling and worth adopting in terms of our general attitude towards
things.
