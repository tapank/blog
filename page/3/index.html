		Whatever you do for a living, you are skilled at using a toolset in order to get your job done. A surgeon uses surgical tools to perform surgery and these tools are provided by her employer. Think of any profession or job, the norm is: you bring your skills to work, but the tools to get the work done are provided by your employer.
This is also true for software development industry.

	<div>
		Before OS X Lion, Dashboard was a nice thing to have. Just hit the shortcut key (usually F4) to bring up Dashboard to quickly take a peek at one or many widgets running there, and hit the key again to hide it. You are back to whatever you were doing before — does not matter which of the many desktops you were on.
Come Lion, creating a new desktop for a full screen application is as easy as hitting the full screen button (on top right corner of any window).

		Java language specification 3.0 defines a switch block as:
 The body of a switch statement is known as a switch block. Any statement immediately contained by the switch block may be labeled with one or more case or default labels. These labels are said to be associated with the switch statement, as are the values of the constant expressions in the case labels.
 One of the valid forms of constant expression is: Parenthesized expressions whose contained expression is a constant expression, and examples are:

Food - When you feel agitated, try eating some carbs.
Exercise - Think of exercise as the difference between a good day and a bad day. That is reason enough to exercise.
Goals - Have at least one project brewing at all times that has a non-zero chance of changing the planet, or making a billion dollars, or both.

		After using Google+ for a day, here are my first impressions.
The good parts:  Google+ connections are modeled on Twitter. A ‘handshake’ is not necessary for two people to connect. Just follow people on Google+ without having them to first approve the connection by accepting a ‘friend request’. Quick and easy way to define an audience for each post. If a post is marked as public, everybody can read that post — even those who do not have a Google+ account.

		Getting started on something new can be challenging. While it is surprising, it is true, that one would find it difficult to get started on a project of their own choosing. Typical examples of new projects are: exercise, new business, new job, new skill, quitting a bad habit, etc. Why would it be difficult to embark upon a journey that you actually want to begin? The strongest reasons are the fear of unknown, and the fear of failure.
