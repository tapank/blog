        <p>Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, I have not worked out. Let me admit,
I&rsquo;ve been slacking. This attitude needs to change, and change it will.</p>

<p>Keep watching.</p>

        <p>Last evening, I was scheduled to run for 30 minutes. I hit the gym to do my
bit, and started off on the treadmill, with the timer set to 30 minutes. Due
to popularity of the treadmills and at the same time, lack of a good number
(there are only 3 at the gym), the use of this machine is restricted to 20
mintunes at a time. I did not want to raise eyebrows by violating that rule,
and therefore, I got off the machine at 20 minutes and started running out of
the gym and hit the road. Finished the remaining 10 minutes on the road
(around the block in the neighborhood) and this was like a test for the days
to come. I felt good running on the road after a long time. And, as noted by
Tim in <em>Lore of Running</em>, I had not forgotten running. My body took it very
well.</p>

<p>Starting today, I have switched to the morning routine as planned, and today
walked 45 minutes in the neighborhood. Now, during the day, I can feel a bit
of soreness all over my body and it feels good.</p>

<p>I have also thrown in some stretching at the end of my run, and that seems to
help. Overall, this first week of daily activity is going to take its toll but
I am happy this is the begining of a journey that I hope to be very enjoyable
very soon.</p>

        <p>Yesterday evening, I started on the new plan. It was a walk day, and I went
out for a 45 mintute walk. I have to admit, the experience was not that great.
Pollution was severe, even with low traffic due to all India bandh, and I can
only image how bad the pollution will be on a normal work day.</p>

<p>I have two options: 1. stick to indoor activities in the gym, or 2. pick a
time and route with least pollution. For now, I am going to pick 2. Though its
well known that mornings are the least favorable time for workouts, because of
the body&rsquo;s lack of readiness for activity, I am going to have to pick that
time for my daily walks and runs. And the route… I am going to make circles
around the big block in my neighbourhood and avoid taking yesterday&rsquo;s route
near the main road. Having to do multiple circles around he block is going to
be a bit monotonous but I prefer that over breathing in smoke and dust.</p>

<p>Overall the 45 minute walk was energizing (in spite of the above) and am
looking forward to my run today evening in the gym and then starting tomorrow,
the mornings will be the time for my runs and walks.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lore-Running-4th-Timothy-
Noakes/dp/0873229592" target="_blank">Tim Noakes&rsquo; Lore of Running</a> is turning out to be a very good read. Tim&rsquo;s narrative
is convincing and it would be a waste to not follow his advice on running, at
least as a beginner. After running on and off during the last decade, I am now
ready to take running seriously.</p>

<p>First off, I now have a plan in place. So far, I have chalked out some
outlines of the plan. For starters, its going to be a one year plan. This is a
good enough horizon that is not too far off in the future and at the same
time, provides enough time to produce tangible results. So, in the next one
year, I will be working out for 10 solid months and then take a 2 month break,
which Tim says is essential for a serious runner who wants to continue to run
for many years and decades.</p>

<p>Breaking that down further, I also have a plan for this month. Its a run a day
/ walk a day, covering 6 days a week. This is designed to just form a habit of
getting out of the door and working out for half an hour or more. Its simple:
run 30 minutes a day and walk 45 minutes the next day. Repeat from Monday
through Saturday, and rest on Sunday.</p>

<p>This phase (I call it Phase 1) will last for 2 months, and the regimen for
month 2 (i.e. August) will probably vary only a little from what I have
planned for this month. The idea is to just incorporate my learning from this
month into the next, without altering the goal of this phase, which is, get
into a habit of exercising. Though I have not set foot on the road with this
new plan, I am already feeling positive and the chances of success seem to be
high because this plan is not overly ambitious or unrealistic.</p>

<p>And while I plan and implement this one year fitness plan, I expect to get
better at planning itself. Thats two birds with one stone.</p>

    </h1>
</header>


        
        <p>Ian Taylor notes in his <a href="http://www.airs.com/blog/archives/294" target="_blank">blog post</a> about the rise of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming" target="_blank">Cargo Cult Programming</a>:</p>

<p>In today’s increasingly complex world of programming, when so much code involves integrating libraries in various ways, I expect that cargo cult programming is on the rise.</p>

<p>He is talking in context of developing open source software, but this applies to proprietary software development as well. In a commercial software development enterprise, cargo cult is less likely to be noticed or pointed out because peer review is no longer deemed necessary as there is so much to do with so few people to go around. Its easier to just turn a blind eye.</p>

<p>One of the many possible reasons, at least in corporations, can be the increasing pressure to deliver by an arbitrary deadline set by someone who does not really understand the work involved. In such situations, developers confront a couple of options when faced with a seemingly impossible goal:</p>

<p>Reason with the management to help them see why a deadline will be missed; or
Go ahead and put together software that will be accepted by customer, with little concern for the day after; or
Create a culture and a team that can deliver good software which meets aggressive schedule. Every team strives (even if pretends) to reach here.
Afraid of trying (or after trying) option 1, developers take the easy route with option 2. They cut corners, copy/paste code, and do anything that needs to be done — in order to meet a deadline. And then they deliver. Everybody is happy, and life goes on. The feature is accepted and deployed.</p>

<p>The aftermath will be dealt with by technical support. What are they paid for, after all?</p>

    </h1>
</header>


        
        <p>I love living in my own little world, which is made up of my little computer (Acer Aspire One) and allows me to go find refuge in a different world for whatever time I can spare every day. Its not just about the form factor of this little machine — which is impressive, by the way — but its more of what’s on this machine.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with this little laptop, which is categorized as a netbook in general computer parlance, it is a 8.9″ screen portable computer that runs on Intel’s Atom (dual core) processor and has 1G RAM, 160G HDD and all the fixtures you may expect in a laptop sans CD ROM drive. On this little marvel, I run my favourite applications like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firefox (My favorite browser)</li>
<li>gVim (My favorite text editor)</li>
<li>TweetDeck (My favourite twitter client)</li>
<li>BlogDesk (My favorite blogging software)</li>
<li>Thunderbird (My favorite email client)</li>
<li>Adobe Reader (This is all you need to read most ebooks)</li>
</ul>

<p>Everytime I have some time, all I need is my wifi to be switched on, and I am happy to just watch time pass by while I read/surf/blog/tweet/watch things that I like.</p>

<p>All I can say is I am happy to be living in this day and age of the internet. Life would be very different if we did not have all of the above, to take me to the world of my own, where I live happily as long as I need to.</p>

<p>And when I still have time, I love going out for a run. There are days when I am able to do both, and thats when it feels like nothing can go wrong. Not often, but there are days like that. Today was one of those days.</p>
