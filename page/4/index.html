		Who do you work for? The company that employs you, or the business within the company that you are part of, or the team that you belong to, or the technology that you work on, or any of the people in the management chain all the way up to CEO of your company? The answer to this question is never straightforward and changes from time to time, and from situation to situation.

		On perception of time
Why time seems to pass faster as we get older
 The more detailed the memory, the longer the moment seems to last. “This explains why we think that time speeds up when we grow older,” Eagleman said—why childhood summers seem to go on forever, while old age slips by while we’re dozing. The more familiar the world becomes, the less information your brain writes down, and the more quickly time seems to pass.

Its hard for companies to let go of their past successes
 What makes a company successful with innovation long term is to always keep innovating. Often coming up with the next big thing means damaging the old thing. That’s hard to do for many companies so they don’t do it and somebody else does. This is why great companies end up as formerly-great companies.

The writing on the wall is clear
 It doesn’t matter if you go running every morning, or you’re a regular at the gym. If you spend most of the rest of the day sitting — in your car, your office chair, on your sofa at home — you are putting yourself at increased risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, a variety of cancers and an early death.

I never thought of Donald Trump this way
 Granted, many people are turned off by Trump’s pomposity. He knows that. But he also knows that success doesn’t come from bland acceptance by the entire world. It comes from the ability to inspire the few. He’s nailing that part. I just spent my morning writing about him.

		The team is working on an upcoming product release. Long days and late nights. Sometimes weekends too. There is so much to do, but so little time! What&rsquo;s more — the test team is finding bugs as if there is no tomorrow. This is the time when developers are thinking about so many things that could have been done differently. &lsquo;Maybe we should have thought through a few things before&rsquo;, they say.
