		Peace of mind produces right values, right values produce right thoughts. Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the center of it all.

	<div>
		There are two kinds of [selfhelp] books:
 Those that tell you why you are the way you are, and that its ok to be the way you are; and Those that tell you how to become what you want to become.  I see value in both of the above, but time spent reading the second type feels like more bang for the buck.

	<div>
		One thing that keeps us going more than anything else is &ndash; the hope that tomorrow is going to be better than today. This is true no matter what your today looks like. You may be going through the worst day of your life or today may be the best day of your life, but tomorrow needs to be something you look forward to. For example, former Olympians struggle with post Olympic stress disorder because their best days seem to be behind them.

	<div>
		One of the tell tale signs of craftsmen is their natural afinity for building or improving tools. While this may sound unnatural to others, a craftsman does not have to think about this; it comes to him naturally &ndash; improving existing tools or building new tools.
When I am interviewing a candidate for a job, I always ask this question: &ldquo;Tell me about the tools you have built or improved to make you more effective at your job.

	<div>
		Moving to a new job and a new city threw me off track in many ways. Now, I think things are falling back in place and I may soon be on track. This means, some of the things that I did outside of work &ndash; and had become used to &ndash; will again become possible.
Just being able to post a few words on my blog feels great.

	<div>
		I have started reading &ldquo;On writing well&rdquo; by William Zinsser and just from reading chapter 1, I can see what makes this book tick. It is a sequel to the seminal work on this subject &ndash; &ldquo;Elements of style&rdquo; by Strunk and White. I have enjoyed reading &ldquo;Elements of style&rdquo; so much that it left me with a longing for more on the topic; and &ldquo;On writing well&rdquo; satisfies that craving.

	<div>
		Ideas are what lead to new things. The two different stages in this process of creating something new are &ndash; the idea and the implementation. So first, there needs to be an idea &ndash; that moment of inspiration when a thought is born which promises to be a seed to doing or creating something new or different, possibly even useful (lucky you if it is useful because most ideas are useless).

	<div>
		Joel Spolsky blogs about software development and points out wasteful inventories.
In the post, he makes an interesting observation about feature backlog:
 Every product attracts new feature ideas, and you can’t implement ideas as fast as you can think them up, so you write them down, and this list is called the feature backlog. A lot of the ideas on the backlog are bad ideas, and you merely wrote them down to avoid hurting the feelings of the people who thought them up.

		Atul Gawande talks about the difference between triumph and defeat.
 So you will take risks, and you will have failures. But it’s what happens afterward that is defining. A failure often does not have to be a failure at all. However, you have to be ready for it—will you admit when things go wrong? Will you take steps to set them right?—because the difference between triumph and defeat, you’ll find, isn’t about willingness to take risks.

		Looking at the profile pictures of people on Facebook and Twitter, I see a pattern. From what I have seen so far, the profile pictures fall into one of the following categories:
 Picture of self from the past when they looked much younger/better Current picture of self Picture of a celebrity No picture  I dont know what to make of the last two, but I have been type 1 until recently, and am trying to move to type 2.

		My laptop battery has now reached a point where it cannot hold even for a second, and that requires the machine to be connected to the mains all the time. This works as long as it works, until there is a power failure. This happened recently and it was a reminder that things that we now take for granted were different only a few years ago. In those days, we were reminded to save our work frequently and for those unlucky ones who lost an hour or more of work, we would laugh at their plight.

		This is my first post from the Linux system since I moved from Windows to Linux on my work computer. If you are seeing this post, the setup is now complete. But I have to say what a pain it is to get the Octopress setup right, if you are not a ruby developer. But there is no point in complaining too much because Octopress in general is very likable.

		I recently switched from Windows 7 to Xubuntu at work and am very happy that I did. To be clear, this is not to compare Windows with Linux, but just that as a software engineer I find Linux (with Xfce for desktop management) more fun than any other OS I have used so far.

		It was late one night in Vienna when I was walking the streets with a colleague &ndash; hopping from one pub to the next &ndash; trying out different beers in this beautiful European city. We were there attending a technical conference, and there was nothing much to do after dark except make the most of this time exploring the hosting city. As we walked the streets late into the night, we talked about various things ranging from work, to hobby, to technology in general, and so on.

		As a software developer, what do you expect to accomplish on the first day on your job? Certainly not checking in code. But here is an example of a company where you would be expected to do just that.
Ok, so why does this matter? In a small to mid sized team, say up 20 people, new engineers do not join your every other week. So why solve the problem of having a new engineer commit code on day one?

		Here are my highlights for the year 2011. Just want to put this on record while I am still reflecting on the year that was. After this, I will once again turn around and look straight ahead.
 I&rsquo;ve been using MacBook for over a year and found my fondness for it grow. Even with continued use, the fascination has not worn off a bit. More I use my MacBook, more I like it.

		As a year ends, and yet another begins, the following is a good reminder:
 The thing is, we still live in a world that&rsquo;s filled with opportunity. In fact, we have more than an opportunity &ndash; we have an obligation. An obligation to spend our time doing great things. To find ideas that matter and to share them. To push ourselves and the people around us to demonstrate gratitude, insight, and inspiration.

		This blog was hosted on wordpress until today. Starting with this post, the new home is github pages. Also, my online scrap book, i.e. my tumblog, has also moved here to github pages and is merged with my blog. This makes it easier to maintain the two streams as one. I was paying wordpress for using my personal domain name for the blog, but github allows this for free.
Another change with this move is that I am using Octopress to manage my blog posts.
