		I have a theory that the rational side of your brain is only as strong as your language skills. You assume that a person who is logical can, as a result of that logical facility, write a clear and persuasive sentence. But I think causation works the other way. I think language creates logic. The stronger your language skills are, the better your logic becomes. You can never be more rational than your vocabulary allows.

		Lately, I&rsquo;ve been taking notes like never before … and hold your breath … in physical note books! I can see some of the benefits already, and these are nothing new. One is (the good old cliche): never forget anything. Another: by writing down somehting, I see its easier to remember that thing even without having to look it up. Looks like the pause that is necessary to note something down in a physical notebook is also sufficient to write that down in the brain&rsquo;s memory.

		Last evening, I was scheduled to run for 30 minutes. I hit the gym to do my bit, and started off on the treadmill, with the timer set to 30 minutes. Due to popularity of the treadmills and at the same time, lack of a good number (there are only 3 at the gym), the use of this machine is restricted to 20 mintunes at a time. I did not want to raise eyebrows by violating that rule, and therefore, I got off the machine at 20 minutes and started running out of the gym and hit the road.

		Yesterday evening, I started on the new plan. It was a walk day, and I went out for a 45 mintute walk. I have to admit, the experience was not that great. Pollution was severe, even with low traffic due to all India bandh, and I can only image how bad the pollution will be on a normal work day.
I have two options: 1. stick to indoor activities in the gym, or 2.

		[Tim Noakes&rsquo; Lore of Running](http://www.amazon.com/Lore-Running-4th-Timothy- Noakes/dp/0873229592) is turning out to be a very good read. Tim&rsquo;s narrative is convincing and it would be a waste to not follow his advice on running, at least as a beginner. After running on and off during the last decade, I am now ready to take running seriously.
First off, I now have a plan in place. So far, I have chalked out some outlines of the plan.

		Ian Taylor notes in his [blog post] 1 about the rise of [Cargo Cult Programming] 2:
In today’s increasingly complex world of programming, when so much code involves integrating libraries in various ways, I expect that cargo cult programming is on the rise.
He is talking in context of developing open source software, but this applies to proprietary software development as well. In a commercial software development enterprise, cargo cult is less likely to be noticed or pointed out because peer review is no longer deemed necessary as there is so much to do with so few people to go around.

		I love living in my own little world, which is made up of my little computer (Acer Aspire One) and allows me to go find refuge in a different world for whatever time I can spare every day. Its not just about the form factor of this little machine — which is impressive, by the way — but its more of what’s on this machine.
If you are not familiar with this little laptop, which is categorized as a netbook in general computer parlance, it is a 8.

	<b><time>16.02.2009 00:00</time></b>
	
	<div>
		LTE ([Long Term Evolution] 1), the most popular pet project from 3GPP promises to deliver data speeds upto 100 MBps. And this is in not-so-distant future even by the standards of internet time. They say the first commercial deployments should go live in 2010 and LTE will be mainstream by 2012.
Now, let me start imagining the consequences of having such data speeds available on a wireless medium, when the norm now (in early 2009) is data speeds in the range of a few Kbps on most networks in most places.

	<div>
		I have come across research that shows it takes 21 days to form a new habit. This also applies to breaking an old habit and it can be argued that breaking an old habit is — depending on how you look at it — the same as forming a new habit. Nevertheless, I thought of trying this out and decided to form a habit of running daily in 21 days.

		Yesterday I talked about the future of publishing and said plagiarism will be detected early and often due to the possibility of searching the internet, including searching in eBooks. Today, New York Times ran an article which talks about just one such incident where plagiarism has been detected and the guilty has admitted having done that. Though the article does not refer to a &lsquo;book search&rsquo; that made it possible, I am guessing that is the case.

		Books used to be precious commodities when there were only printed copies of them. Even the authors had only one or two carbon copies of the original manuscript which they painstakingly created by typing on paper sheets with carbon papers sandwiched in between those pages. I guess the criteria to determine the number of carbon copies would have been authors’ age and the strength of his fingers because the harder he can type, the more copies he can create.

		The pleasure of reading — nothing can beat that. The comparison is with the alternative, i.e. listening, which is gaining popularity. I have been listening to podcasts for a while now and I do enjoy the experience. However, when it comes to listing to audio books, thats quite a different thing. After trying to listen to an audio book, I gave up after the first two chapters, and after that trial I did not try doing that again.

Lets see how this goes. For now, all I say is: I shall blog. Thats it for today. Wait for more messages in the near future.
