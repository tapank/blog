				<p>I have started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0060891548">&ldquo;On writing well&rdquo;</a> by <a href="http://www.williamzinsserwriter.com/">William Zinsser</a> and just from reading chapter 1, I can see what makes this book tick. It is a sequel to the seminal work on this subject &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style">&ldquo;Elements of style&rdquo;</a> by Strunk and White. I have enjoyed reading &ldquo;Elements of style&rdquo; so much that it left me with a longing for more on the topic; and &ldquo;On writing well&rdquo; satisfies that craving.</p>
<p>There is more to this book than just [literary] writing. Surprisingly, the insights gained from reading the first chapter go beyond the craft of writing &ndash; to software development, i.e. writing code. Following are a few assertions that the author makes which apply to writing code as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing is not easy and fun. It is hard and lonely, and the words seldom just flow. <em>(So is programming, but <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">readme driven development</a> can help.)</em></li>
<li>Rewriting is the essence of writing. Professional writers rewrite their sentences over and over. <em>(In other words, <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/refactor.html">refactor</a> your code all the time.)</em></li>
<li>Writing is a craft, not an art. <em>(<a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_backg.html">Practice</a> your craft as a programmer.)</em></li>
<li>If your job is writing, you learn to do it every day. Like any other job. <em>(<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/18/mark-zuckerberg-code_n_1525333.html">Write code every day</a> no matter your job title.)</em></li>
<li>Professional writers are solitary drudges who seldom see other writers. <em>(Many successful software developers too work alone &ndash; here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.marco.org/about">an example</a>.)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I am happy to be reading this book.</p>
