				<p>Who do you work for? The company that employs you, or the business within the company that you are part of, or the team that you belong to, or the technology that you work on, or any of the people in the management chain all the way up to CEO of your company? The answer to this question is never straightforward and changes from time to time, and from situation to situation. The simple answer is: it depends.</p>
<p>My view is that all of the above matter. Not necessarily to the same degree but they all matter nonetheless. You are lucky if what matters most to you results in the best outcome for you â€” both in terms of compensation and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>However, you need to pick one out of the above so you can check from time to time if its still worth continuing in your current job. I think, happiest are those who focus in their job on creating a great product or technology.</p>
