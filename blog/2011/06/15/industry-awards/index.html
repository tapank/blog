			<h1>Industry awards</h1>

			<div>
				<p>Businesses covet industry awards for multiple reasons. These help boost visibility of the company or the award winning product to different audiences, for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing and potential customers; and</li>
<li>Potential employees</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon receiving an award, it is perfectly normal and even desirable to turn to any of the above and make sure they are aware of this award. It is a moment of pride, and should be relished as such. It should also be advertised as such.</p>
<p>But if you want an award that you can bring to your existing employees to make them proud and happy, then stop. That industry award will not cut it. [I am assuming you have all the other variables under control: salary, work/life balance, good work environment etc.] Your existing employees want just one award: being proud of what they produce. Unless that experience trumps all their other experiences at work, they will never quite feel as rewarded as you want them to do.</p>
