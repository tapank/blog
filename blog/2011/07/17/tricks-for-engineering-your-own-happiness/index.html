          <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams" target="_blank">Scott Adams</a>&rsquo; tricks for
engineering your own happiness. Condensed from a <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/happiness_engineering" target="_blank">blog
post</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Food</strong> - When you feel agitated, try eating some carbs.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong> - Think of exercise as the difference between a good day and a bad day. That is reason enough to exercise.</p>

<p><strong>Goals</strong> - Have at least one project brewing at all times that has a non-zero chance of changing the planet, or making a billion dollars, or both. That is a good feeling to wake up to.</p>

<p><strong>Meaning</strong> - First, achieve personal success. Once you reach a more comfortable level, be useful to others in order to find meaning and feel right in your own skin.</p>

<p><strong>Positivity</strong> - Have an ongoing positive dialog with yourself. Do not incorporate negativity even in your humor. Saying positive things puts your mind into a positive state and attracts positive relationships and positive outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>A Little Bit of Danger</strong> - Make it a habit to try new things, even if those things scare you a bit.</p>

<p><strong>Learn</strong> - Feed your brain. The more active your brain is, the more alive you will feel.</p>

<p><strong>Feel Success</strong> - Make it a habit to often do things you do well. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what that is but doing one thing well gives your ego armor to handle the little things that don&rsquo;t go quite so well.</p>

<p><strong>Relationships</strong> - Follow the other tips for happiness to attract the sort of relationships you want.</p>

<p>Happiness can be engineered, and luck is a product of good design.</p>
