			<h1>Craftsmen build tools</h1>

				<p>One of the tell tale signs of craftsmen is their natural afinity for building or improving tools. While this may sound unnatural to others, a craftsman does not have to think about this; it comes to him naturally &ndash; improving existing tools or building new tools.</p>
<p>When I am interviewing a candidate for a job, I always ask this question: &ldquo;Tell me about the tools you have built or improved to make you more effective at your job.&rdquo; Craftsman&rsquo;s eyes light up, he sits straight with an improved posture, leans forward and starts talking about the tool(s) he developed and how it made a difference in the way he and his team accomplished their daily tasks. He forgets that he is answering an interview question, because now we are in his teritory which he knows like the back of his hand and he is most proud of having built. All I need to do now is find out how well he did what he loves doing most.</p>
<p>I need at least one craftsman on my team who helps sharpen the metaphorical saw while others saw away at the trees.</p>
