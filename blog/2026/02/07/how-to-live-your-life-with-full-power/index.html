				<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxoCnxlxpIk">Watched a video</a> by Graham Weaver where he gives a &ldquo;last lecture&rdquo;
to the graduating class of 2024 at Stanford Graduate School of Business,
and he talks about what keeps us blocked from making progress on our
dreams.  We have two voices within us.  One is the loud voice in our
head which constantly protects us from danger and is very instinctive,
and this is what keeps us from doing what we know we need to do.  It
does not tell us not to do it, but it warns us that now is not the right
time.  The other voice inside us which can be thought of as our soul,
the god, etc. is much more mild and this is the voice that tells what we
are meant to be doing in life.  When we follow this soul or inner voice,
we are full of energy, and that is how it guides us through our whole
body.  In most cases, the other louder voice keeps us from either
listening to our soul or makes us forget what it told us.</p>
<p>In order to silence the louder voice so that we can listen to our soul,
and then follow what the soul tells us, there are three steps:</p>
<h2 id="1-take-the-nail-out-of-your-head">1. Take the nail out of your head.</h2>
<p>This is a metaphor for something that is holding you down in all walks
of life because it is constantly in your head and prevents you from
thinking or doing anything else meaningful in life.  It could be an
addiction, a bad relationship, a bad job, a bad environment etc.  The
idea is to remove this metaphorical nail from your head so that you can
then focus on what you want to do.  He also warns us that when you
remove this nail from your head, things become worse before they get
better.</p>
<h2 id="2-follow-your-energy">2. Follow your energy.</h2>
<p>Once you are in a position to listen to your soul, pay attention to what
it says.  Do what gives you more energy and keep following that path.
This is how the soul speaks to you. Instead of following your passions,
be guided by your energy.</p>
<h2 id="3-go-all-in">3. Go all in.</h2>
<p>Once you are on a path that your soul has revealed, the only way to make
progress is to go all in.  When we are not sure about what we are doing
and we are afraid of failure, we never give ourselves to that path, and
we wonder why we are not making progress.  Solution is to go all in.</p>
