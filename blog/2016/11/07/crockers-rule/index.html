				<p>Crocker&rsquo;s rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Declaring yourself to be operating by &ldquo;Crocker&rsquo;s Rules&rdquo; means that other people are allowed to optimize their messages for information, not for being nice to you.  Crocker&rsquo;s Rules means that you have accepted full responsibility for the operation of your own mind - if you&rsquo;re offended, it&rsquo;s your fault.  Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim to be doing you a favor.  (Which, in point of fact, they would be.  One of the big problems with this culture is that everyone&rsquo;s afraid to tell you you&rsquo;re wrong, or they think they have to dance around it.)  Two people using Crocker&rsquo;s Rules should be able to communicate all relevant information in the minimum amount of time, without paraphrasing or social formatting.  Obviously, don&rsquo;t declare yourself to be operating by Crocker&rsquo;s Rules unless you have that kind of mental discipline.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note that Crocker&rsquo;s Rules does not mean you can insult people; it means that other people don&rsquo;t have to worry about whether they are insulting you.</strong>  Crocker&rsquo;s Rules are a discipline, not a privilege.  Furthermore, taking advantage of Crocker&rsquo;s Rules does not imply reciprocity.  How could it?  Crocker&rsquo;s Rules are something you do for yourself, to maximize information received - not something you grit your teeth over and do as a favor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Crocker&rsquo;s Rules&rdquo; are named after Lee Daniel Crocker.</p>
