         Journals and notebooks

        <div class="entry-content">
          <p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been taking notes like never before … and hold your breath … in
physical note books! I can see some of the benefits already, and these are
nothing new. One is (the good old cliche): never forget anything. Another: by
writing down somehting, I see its easier to remember that thing even without
having to look it up. Looks like the pause that is necessary to note something
down in a physical notebook is also sufficient to write that down in the
brain&rsquo;s memory. No wonder so many notebooks and journals are popular in this
digital age. BTW, I dont think taking notes on a computer has the same
benefits as taking notes on a physical book. Though you can record much more
on a computer, and retrieve or search that information much faster on a
computer, its not as romantic as doing the same in a notebook. I think the
benefits are clear in both cases. If you are taking notes for work, go for the
computer if thats what you spent more time on, and if you are taking notes for
yourself, like getting your life organized, planning for the future, recording
your experiences etc like in a diary, then use the physical notebook.</p>

<p>With the digital age gaining steam, and the physical book publishers starting
to go all digital, the day is not far when very few printed books will be
available. However, the demand for physical journals and notebooks will
continue for a long time to come.</p>
