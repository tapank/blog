				<p>Recently I came across a nice tip in the book &ldquo;Indistractable: How To
Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life&rdquo; by Nir Eyal.  The author
asserts that the solution to avoiding distractions is not to abstain from
the things that are distracting us but to identify the inner triggers that
lead to distraction and manage them instead. This is really powerful
because now we can no longer pin the blame for <em>our</em> distractions on
<em>their</em> products.</p>
<p>Distraction tricks us into prioritizing the urgent and easy over hard and
long term.  There are two kinds of triggers: external and internal.
According to the author, only 10% of the triggers are external but 90% are
internal!  Most distractions begin inside, and are usually caused by
boredom, fatigue, loneliness, anxiety, stress, etc.  And the root cause of
distractions is our inability to deal with these discomforts.  One tool to
avoid distraction is the 10 minute rule.  When you are on a task and the
urge for distraction strikes, do one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell yourself that you will scratch the urge but not yet. Get back to
the task for at least 10 minutes. Generally, the urge subsides and you
will be able to continue on your task.</li>
<li>Surf the urge. Literally sit and observe your urge but do not act on it
for at least 10 minutes. When we observe the urge, we soon learn that it
is like a wave and it subsides soon.</li>
</ol>
<p>This trick generally works. I would like to add one more thing on top of
what the author has suggested, and that is to address the emotions which
are listed as triggers above. If we can manage those, there will be less of
a need to manage distractions in the first place. Definitely worth trying.</p>
