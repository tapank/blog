				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Teilhard_de_Chardin">Pierre Teilhard de Chardin</a> delivered a lecture in Peking (now
Beijing) about happiness on 28 December 1943.  It was published as a
book by the name On Happiness, and is worth a read.  This book is now
hard to find and hence I am sharing the text below for the curious.
Note that he refers to Christianity a few times but if you replace that
with whatever faith you like, the text still remains relevant, at least
in my opinion.  It is a quick read and worth rereading every once in a
while.  Enjoy!</p>

<p>REFLECTIONS ON HAPPINESS</p>
<ol>
<li>The Theoretical Axes of Happiness</li>
<li>The Fundamental Rules of Happiness</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="reflections-on-happiness">Reflections on Happiness</h1>
<p>In the world of mechanized matter, all bodies obey the laws of a
universal gravitation; similarly, in the world of vitalized matter, all
organized beings, even the very lowest, steer themselves and progress
towards that quarter in which the greatest measure of well-being is to
be found.</p>
<p>One might well imagine, then, that a speaker could hardly choose an
easier subject than happiness.  He is a living being addressing other
living beings, and he might well be pardoned for believing that his
audience contains none but such as are already in agreement with him and
are familiar with his ideas.</p>
<p>In practice, however, the task I have set myself today turns out to be
much nicer and more complex.</p>
<p>Like all other animate beings, man, it is true, has an essential craving
for happiness.  In man, however, this fundamental demand assumes a new
and complicated form: for he is not simply a living being with greater
sensibility and greater vibratory power than other living beings.  By
virtue of his &lsquo;hominization&rsquo; he has become a reflective and critical
living being; and his gift of reflection brings with it two other
formidable properties, the power to perceive what may be possible, and
the power to foresee the future.  The emergence of this dual power is
sufficient to disturb and confuse the hitherto serene and consistent
ascent of life.  Perception of the possible, and awareness of the
future — when these two combine, they not only open up for us an
inexhaustible store of hopes and fears, but they also allow those hopes
and fears to range far afield in every direction.  Where the animal
seems to find no difficulties to obstruct its infallible progress
towards what will bring it satisfaction, man, on the other hand, cannot
take a single step in any direction without meeting a problem for which,
ever since he became man, he has constantly and unsuccessfully been
trying to find a final and universal solution.</p>
<p>&lsquo;De vita beata&rsquo;, in the ancient phrase — on the happy life: what, in
fact, is happiness?</p>
<p>For centuries this has been the subject of endless books,
investigations, individual and collective experiments, one after
another; and, sad to relate, there has been complete failure to reach
unanimity.  For many of us, in the end, the only practical conclusion to
be drawn from the whole discussion is that it is useless to continue the
search.  Either the problem is insoluble — there is no true happiness in
this world — or there can be only an infinite number of particular
solutions — the problem itself defies solution.  Being happy is a matter
of personal taste.  You, for your part, like wine and good living.  I
prefer cars, poetry, or helping others.  &lsquo;Liking is as unaccountable as
luck.&rsquo;  You must often, I am sure, have heard that sort of remark, and
it may well be that you are a little inclined to agree.</p>
<p>What I want to do this evening is to confront fairly and squarely this
relativist (and basically pessimist) skepticism shared by so many of our
contemporaries, by showing you that, even for man, the general direction
in which happiness lies is by no means so ill-defined as it is taken to
be: provided always that we confine our inquiry to the search for those
joys which are essential and, in so doing, take as our basis what we are
taught by science and biology.</p>
<p>I cannot, unfortunately, give you happiness: but I do hope that I may be
able at least to help you to find it.</p>
<p>What I have to say falls into two parts.  In the first, which will be
primarily theoretical, we shall try together to define the best route
leading to human happiness.</p>
<p>In the second part, which will serve as a conclusion, we shall consider
how we must adapt our individual lives to these general axes which run
towards happiness.</p>
<h1 id="1-the-theoretical-axes-of-happiness">1. THE THEORETICAL AXES OF HAPPINESS</h1>
<h2 id="a-the-root-of-the-problem-three-different-attitudes-to-life">A. The Root of the Problem: Three Different Attitudes to Life</h2>
<p>If we are to understand more clearly how the problem of happiness
presents itself to us, and why we find ourselves at a loss when we meet
it, it is essential to start by taking a comprehensive view of the whole
position.  By this I mean that we must distinguish three fundamental
initial attitudes to life adopted by men as a matter of <em>fact</em>.</p>
<p>Here an analogy may well be a useful guide.</p>
<p>Let us imagine a party of tourists who have set out to climb a difficult
peak, and let us take a look at them some hours after they have started.
By this time we may suppose the party to be divided into three sorts of
elements.</p>
<p>Some are regretting having left the inn.  The fatigue and risks involved
seem out of all proportion to the value of a successful climb.  They
decide to turn back.</p>
<p>Others are not sorry that they set out.  The sun is shining, and there
is a beautiful view.  But what is the point of climbing any higher?
Surely it is better to enjoy the mountain from here, in the open meadow
or deep in the wood.  And so they stretch out on the grass, or explore
the neighborhood until it is time for a picnic meal.</p>
<p>And lastly there are the others, the real mountaineers, who keep their
eyes fixed on the peaks they have sworn to climb.</p>
<p>The tired — the hedonists — the enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Three types of men: and, deep within our own selves, we hold the germ of
all three.  And, what is more, it is into these three types that the
mankind in which we live and move has always been divided.</p>
<h3 id="1-first-the-tired-or-the-pessimists">1. First, the Tired (or the Pessimists)</h3>
<p>For this first category of men, existence is a mistake or a failure.  We
do not fit in — and so the best thing we can do is, as gracefully as
possible, to retire from the game.  If this attitude is carried to its
extreme, and expressed in terms of a learned doctrinal system, it leads
in the end to the wisdom of the Hindus, according to which the universe
is an illusion and a prison — or to a pessimism such as Schopenhauer&rsquo;s.
But, in a milder and commoner form, the same attitude emerges and can be
recognized in any number of practical decisions that are only too
familiar to you.  &lsquo;What is the good of trying to find the answer?&hellip;
Why not leave the savages to their savagery and the ignorant to their
ignorance?  What is the point of science?  What is the point of the
machine?  Is it not better to lie down than to stand up?  Better to be
dead than asleep in bed?&rsquo;  And all this amounts to saying, at least by
implication, that it is better to be less than to be more — and that
best of all would be not to be at all.</p>
<h3 id="2-secondly-the-hedonists-or-pleasure-seekers">2. Secondly, the Hedonists (or Pleasure-seekers)</h3>
<p>For men of this second type, to be is certainly better than not to be.
But we must be careful to note that in this case &rsquo;to be&rsquo; has a special
meaning.  For the followers of this school, to be or to live does not
mean to act, but simply to take your fill of this present moment.  To
enjoy each moment and each thing, husbanding it jealously so that
nothing of it be allowed to be lost — and above all with no thought of
shifting one&rsquo;s ground — that is what they mean by wisdom.  When we have
had enough, then we can lie back on the grass, or stretch our legs, or
look at the view from another spot.  And meanwhile, what is more, we
shall not rule out the possibility of turning back downhill.  We refuse,
however, to risk anything for the sake of or on the chance of the future
— unless, in an over-refinement of sensibility, danger incurred for its
own sake goes to our heads, whether it be in order to enjoy the thrill
of taking a chance or to feel the shuddering grip of fear.</p>
<p>This is our own version, in an over-simplified form, of the old pagan
hedonism found in the school of Epicurus.  In literary circles such has
recently been the tendency, at any rate, of a Paul Morand or a
Montherlant — or (and here it is far more subtle) of a Gide (the Gide of
<em>Fruits of the Earth</em>), whose ideal of life is to drink without ever
quenching (rather, indeed, in such a way as to increase) one&rsquo;s thirst —
and this with no idea of restoring one&rsquo;s vigor, but simply from a desire
to drain, ever more avidly, each new source.</p>
<h3 id="3-finally-the-enthusiasts">3. Finally, the Enthusiasts</h3>
<p>By these I mean those for whom living is an ascent and a discovery.  To
men in this third category, not only is it better to be than not to be,
but they are convinced that it is always possible — and the possibility
has a unique value — to attain a fuller measure of being.  For these
conquerors, enamored by the adventurous, being is inexhaustible — not in
Gide&rsquo;s way, like a precious stone with innumerable facets which one can
never tire of turning round and round — but like a focus of warmth and
light to which one can always draw closer.  We may laugh at such men and
say that they are ingenuous, or we may find them tiresome; but at the
same time it is they who have made us what we are, and it is from them
that tomorrow&rsquo;s earth is going to emerge.</p>
<p>Pessimism and return to the past; enjoyment of the present moment; drive
towards the future.  There, as I was saying, we have three fundamental
attitudes to life.  Inevitably, therefore, we find ourselves back at the
very heart of our subject: a confrontation between three contrasting
forms of happiness.</p>
<h3 id="1-first-the-happiness-of-tranquility">1. First, the Happiness of Tranquility</h3>
<p>No worry, no risk, no effort.  Let us cut down our contacts, let us
restrict our needs, let us dim our lights, toughen our protective skin,
withdraw into our shell.  — The happy man is the man who attains a
minimum of thought, feeling and desire.</p>
<h3 id="2-secondly-the-happiness-of-pleasure">2. Secondly, the Happiness of Pleasure</h3>
<p>Static pleasure or, better still, pleasure that is constantly renewed.
The goal of life is not to act and create, but to make use of
opportunities.  And this again means less effort, or no more effort than
is needed to reach out for a clean glass or a fresh drink.  Lie back and
relax as much as possible, like a leaf drinking in the rays of the sun —
shift your position constantly so that you may feel more fully: that is
the recipe for happiness.  — The happy man is the man who can savor to
the highest degree the moment he holds in his hands.</p>
<h3 id="3-finally-the-happiness-of-growth">3. Finally, the Happiness of Growth</h3>
<p>From this third point of view, happiness has no existence nor value in
itself, as an object which we can pursue and attain as such.  It is no
more than the sign, the effect, the reward (we might say) of
appropriately directed action: a by-product, as Aldous Huxley says
somewhere, of effort.  Modern hedonism is wrong, accordingly, in
suggesting that some sort of renewal of ourselves, no matter what form
it takes, is all that is needed for happiness.  Something more is
required, for no change brings happiness unless the way in which it is
effected involves an <em>ascent</em>.  — The happy man is therefore the man
who, without any direct search for happiness, inevitably finds joy as an
added bonus in the act of forging ahead and attaining the fullness and
finality of his own self.</p>
<p>Happiness of tranquility, happiness of pleasure, and happiness of
development: we have only to look around us to see that at the level of
man it is between these three lines of progress that life hesitates and
its current is divided.</p>
<p>Is it true, as we are so often told, that our choice is determined only
by the dictates of individual taste and temperament?</p>
<p>Or is the contrary true?  That somewhere we can find a reason,
indisputable because objective, for deciding that one of these three
roads is absolutely the best, and is therefore the only road which can
lead us to real happiness?</p>
<h2 id="b-the-answer-given-by-the-facts">B. The Answer Given by the Facts</h2>
<h3 id="1-general-solution-fuller-consciousness-as-the-goal">1. General Solution: Fuller Consciousness as the Goal</h3>
<p>For my part, I am absolutely convinced that such a criterion,
indisputable and objective, does exist — and that it is not mysterious
and hidden away but lies open for all to see.  I hold, too, that in
order to see it all we have to do is to look around and examine nature
in the light of the most recent achievements of physics and biology — in
the light, that is, of our new ideas about the great phenomenon of
evolution.</p>
<p>The time has come, as you must know, when nobody any longer retains any
serious doubts about this: the universe is not &lsquo;ontologically&rsquo; fixed —
in the very depths of its entire mass it has from the beginning of time
been moving in two great opposing currents.  One of these carries matter
towards states of extreme disintegration; the other leads to the
building up of organic units, the higher types of which are of
astronomical complexity and form what we call the &rsquo;living world&rsquo;.</p>
<p>That being so, let us consider the second of these two currents, the
current of life, to which we belong.  For a century or more, scientists,
while admitting the reality of a biological evolution, have been
debating whether the movement in which we are caught up is no more than a
sort of vortex, revolving in a closed circle; or whether it corresponds
to a clearly defined drift, which carries the animate portion of the
world towards some specific higher state.  There is today almost
unanimous agreement that it is the second of these hypotheses which
would appear undoubtedly to correspond to reality.  Life does not
develop complexity without laws, simply by chance.  Whether we consider
it as a whole or in detail, by examining organic beings, it progresses
methodically and irreversibly towards ever higher states of
consciousness.  Thus the final, and quite recent, appearance of man on
the earth is only the logical and consistent result of a process whose
first stages were already initiated at the very origins of our planet.</p>
<p>Historically, life (which means in fact the universe itself, considered
in its most active portion) is a rise of consciousness.  How this
proposition directly affects our interior attitudes and ways of behavior
must, I suggest, be immediately apparent.</p>
<p>We talk endlessly, as I was saying a moment ago, about what is the best
attitude to adopt when we are confronted by our own lives.  Yet, when we
talk in this way, are we not like a passenger in the Paris to Marseilles
express who is still wondering whether he ought to be traveling north
or south?  We go on debating the point: but to what purpose, since the
decision has already been taken without reference to ourselves, and here
we are on board the train?  For more than four hundred million years, on
this earth of ours (or it would be more correct today, since the
beginning of time, in the universe), the vast mass of beings of which we
form a part has been tenaciously and tirelessly climbing towards a
fuller measure of freedom, of sensibility, or inner vision.  And are we
still wondering whither we should be bound?</p>
<p>The truth is that the shadow of the false problems vanishes in the light
of the great cosmic laws.  Unless we are to be guilty of a physical
contradiction (unless, that is, we deny everything that we are and
everything that has made us what we are) we are all obliged, each of us
on his own account, to accept the primordial choice which is built into
the world of which we are the reflective elements.  If we withdraw in
order to diminish our being, and if we stand still to enjoy what we
have, in each case we find that the attempt to run counter to the
universal stream is illogical and impossible.</p>
<p>The road to the left, then, and the road to the right are both closed:
the only way out is straight ahead.</p>
<p>Scientifically and objectively, only one answer can be made to the
demands of life: the advance of progress.</p>
<p>In consequence, and again scientifically and objectively, the only true
happiness is the happiness we have described as the happiness of growth
and movement.</p>
<p>Do we want to be happy, as the world is happy, and with the world?  Then
we must let the tired and the pessimists lag behind.  We must let the
hedonists take their homely ease, lounging on the grassy slope, while we
ourselves boldly join the group of those who are ready to dare the climb
to the topmost peak.  Press on!</p>
<p>Even so, to have chosen the climb is not enough.  We have still to make
sure of the right path.  To get up on our feet ready for the start is
well enough.  But, if we are to have a successful and enjoyable climb,
which is the best route?</p>
<p>Here again, if we are to be sure of our ground, we must see how nature
proceeds — we must learn from the sciences of life.</p>
<h3 id="2-detailed-solution-the-three-phases-of-personalization">2. Detailed Solution: the Three Phases of Personalization</h3>
<p>As I said earlier, life in the world continually rises towards greater
consciousness, proportionate to greater complexity — as though the
increasing complexity of organisms had the effect of deepening the
center of their being.</p>
<p>Let us consider, then, how this advance towards the highest unity
actually works out in detail; and, for the sake of clarity and
simplicity, let us confine ourselves to the case of man — man, who is
physically the highest of all living beings and the one best known to
us.</p>
<p>When we examine the process of our inner unification, that is to say of
our personalization, we can distinguish three allied and successive
stages, or steps, or movements.  If man is to be fully himself and fully
living, he must, (1) be centered upon himself; (2) be &lsquo;de-centered&rsquo; upon
&rsquo;the other&rsquo;; (3) be super-centered upon a being greater then himself.</p>
<p>We must define and explain in turn these three forward movements, with
which (since happiness, we have decided, is an effect of growth) three
forms of attaining happiness must correspond.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, <em>centration</em>.  Not only physically, but intellectually and
morally too, man is man only if he cultivates himself — and that does
not mean simply up to the age of twenty&hellip;  If we are to be fully
ourselves we must therefore work all our lives at our organic
development: by which I mean that we must constantly introduce more
order and more unity into our ideas, our feelings and our behavior.
In this lies the whole program of action, and the whole value and
meaning (all the hard work, too!) of our interior life, with its
inevitable drive towards things that are ever-increasingly spiritual
and elevated.  During this first phase each of us has to take up
again and repeat, working on his own account, the general labor of
life.  Being is in the first place making and finding one&rsquo;s own self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, <em>decentration</em>.  An elementary temptation or illusion lies
in wait for the reflective center which each one of us nurses deep
inside him.  It is present from the very birth of that center; and it
consists in fancying that in order to grow greater each of us should
withdraw into the isolation of his own self, and egoistically pursue
in himself alone the work, peculiar to him, of his own fulfillment:
that we must cut ourselves off from others, or translate everything
into terms of ourselves.  However, there is not just one single man
on the earth.  That there are, on the contrary, and necessarily must
be, myriads and myriads at the same time is only too obvious.  And
yet, when we look at that fact in the general context of physics, it
takes on a cardinal importance — for it means, quite simply, this:
that, however individualized by nature thinking beings may be, each
man still represents no more than an atom, or (if you prefer the
phrase) a very large molecule; in common with all the other similar
molecules, he forms a definite corpuscular system from which he
cannot escape.  Physically and biologically man, like everything else
that exists in nature, is essentially plural.  He is correctly
described as a &lsquo;mass-phenomenon&rsquo;.  This means that, broadly speaking,
we cannot reach our own ultimate without emerging from ourselves by
uniting ourselves with others, in such a way as to develop through
this union an added measure of consciousness — a process which
conforms to the great law of complexity.  Hence the insistence, the
deep surge, of love, which, in all its forms, drives us to associate
our individual center with other chosen and specially favored
centers: love, whose essential function and charm are that it
completes us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, <em>super-centration</em>.  Although this is less obvious, it is
absolutely necessary to understand it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If we are to be fully ourselves, as I was saying, we find that we are
obliged to enlarge the base on which our being rests; in other words, we
have to add to ourselves something of &rsquo;the Other&rsquo;.  Once a small number
of centers of affection have been initiated (some special circumstances
determining their choice), this expansive movement knows no check.
Imperceptibly, and by degrees, it draws us into circles of
ever-increasing radius.  This is particularly noticeable in the world of
today.  From the very beginning, no doubt, man has been conscious of
belonging to one single great mankind.  It is only, however, for our
modern generations that this indistinct social sense is beginning to
take on its full and real meaning.  Throughout the last ten millennia
(which is the period which has brought the sudden speeding-up of
civilization) men have surrendered themselves, with but little
reflection, to the multiple forces (more profound than any war) which
were gradually bringing them into closer contact with one another; but
now our eyes are opening, and we are beginning to see two things.  The
first is that the closed surface of the earth is a constricting and
inelastic mold, within which, under the pressure of an ever-increasing
population and the tightening of economic links, we human beings are
already forming but one single body.  And the second thing is that
through the gradual building-up within that body of a uniform and
universal system of industry and science our thoughts are tending more
and more to function like the cells of one and the same brain.  This
must inevitably mean that as the transformation follows its natural line
of progress we can foresee the time when men will understand what it is,
animated by one single heart, to be united together in wanting, hoping
for, and loving the same things at the same time.</p>
<p>The mankind of tomorrow is emerging from the mists of the future, and we
can actually see it taking shape: a &lsquo;super-mankind&rsquo;, much more
conscious, much more powerful, and much more unanimous than our own.
And at the same time (a point to which I shall return) we can detect an
underlying but deeply rooted feeling that if we are to reach the
ultimate of our own selves, we must do more than link our own being with
a handful of other beings selected from the thousands that surround us:
we must form one whole with all simultaneously.</p>
<p>We can draw but one conclusion from this twofold phenomenon which
operates both outside ourselves and inside ourselves: that what life
ultimately calls upon us to do in order that we may be, is to
incorporate ourselves into, and to subordinate ourselves to, an organic
totality of which, cosmically speaking, we are no more than conscious
particles.  Awaiting us is a center of a higher order — and already we
can distinguish it — not simply beside us, but <em>beyond</em> and <em>above</em> us.</p>
<p>We must, then, do more than develop our own selves — more than give
ourselves to another who is our equal—we must surrender and attach our
lives to one who is greater than ourselves.</p>
<p>In other words: first, be.  Secondly, love.  Finally, worship.</p>
<p>Such are the natural phases of our personalization.</p>
<p>These, you must understand, are three linked steps in life&rsquo;s upward
progress; and they are in consequence three superimposed stages of
happiness — if, as we have agreed, happiness is indissolubly associated
with the deliberate act of climbing.</p>
<p>The happiness of growing greater — of loving — of worshiping.</p>
<p>Taking as our starting-point the laws of life, this, to put it in a
nutshell, is the triple beatitude which is theoretically foreseeable.</p>
<p>Now what is the verdict of experience on this point.  Let us for a
moment go directly to the facts, and use them to check the accuracy of
our deductions.</p>
<p>First, there is the happiness of that deep-seated growth in one&rsquo;s own
self — growth in capabilities, in sensibility, in self-possession.
Then, too, there is the happiness of union with one another, effected
between bodies and souls that are made to complete one another and come
together as one.</p>
<p>I have little need to emphasize the purity and intensity of these two
first forms of joy.  Everybody is in basic agreement on that point.</p>
<p>But what shall we say about the happiness of sinking and losing self in
the future, in one greater than ourselves?&hellip;  Is not this pure
theorizing or dreaming?  To find joy in what is out of scale with us, in
what we can as yet neither touch nor see.  Apart from a few visionaries,
is there anyone in the positivist and materialist world we are forced to
live in who can concern himself with such an idea?</p>
<p>Who, indeed?</p>
<p>And yet, consider for a moment what is happening around us.</p>
<p>Some months ago, at a similar meeting, I was telling you about two
Curies — the husband and wife who found happiness in embarking on a
venture, the discovery of radium, in which they realized that to lose
their life was to gain it.  Just think, then: how many other men (in a
more modest way, maybe, and in different forms and circumstances),
yesterday and today, have been possessed, or are still possessed, even
to the point of death, by the demon of research?  Try to count them.</p>
<p>In the Arctic and Antarctic: Nansen, Andree, Shackleton, Charcot, and
any number of others.</p>
<p>The men of the great peaks: the climbers of Everest.</p>
<p>The laboratory workers who ran such risks: killed by rays or by the
substances they handled — victims of a self-injected disease.</p>
<p>Add to these the legion of aviators who conquered the air.</p>
<p>And those, too, who shared man&rsquo;s conquest of man: all who risked, or
indeed gave, their lives for an idea.</p>
<p>Make a rough count; and when you have done so, take the writings and
letters left by these men (such of them as left any), from the most
noteworthy of them (the everyday names) to the most humble (those whose
names are not even known) — the airmail pilots who twenty-five years ago
were pioneering the air-route across America for human thoughts and
loves, and paid for it, one after another, with their lives.  What do
you find when you read what they confided to paper?  You find joy, a joy
that is both higher and deeper — a joy full of power: the explosive joy
of a life that has at last found a <em>boundless</em> area in which to expand.</p>
<p>Joy, I repeat, in that which knows no bounds.</p>
<p>What generally saps and poisons our happiness is that we feel that we
shall so soon exhaust and reach the end of whatever it is that attracts
us: we know the pain of separation, of loss by attrition — the agony of
seeing time fly past, the terror of knowing how fragile are the good
things we  hold, the disappointment of coming so soon to the end of what
we are and of what we love.</p>
<p>But when a man has found, in an ideal or a cause, the secret of
collaboration and self-identification (whether it be close or distant)
with the universe as it advances, then all those dark shadows disappear.
The joy of worshiping so spreads over the joy of being and the joy of
loving as to allow them to expand and grow firmer (Curie, for example,
and Termier were admirable friends, fathers and husbands): it does not
lessen or destroy the earlier joys, and it holds and brings with it, in
its fullness, a wonderful peace.  Its source of nourishment is
inexhaustible, because it gradually becomes one with the very
consummation of the world in which we move; by the same token, moreover,
it is safe from every threat of death and decay.  Finally, it is, in one
way or another, constantly within our reach, since the best way we have
of reaching it is simply, each one of us in his own place, to do what we
are able to do as well as we can.</p>
<p>The joy of the element which has become conscious of the whole which it
serves and in which it finds fulfillment — the joy which the reflective
atom draws from awareness of its function and completion within the
universe which contains it — this, both logically and factually, is the
highest and most progressive form of happiness I can put before you and
hope that you may attain.</p>
<h1 id="2-the-fundamental-rules-of-happiness">2. THE FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF HAPPINESS</h1>
<p>So much for pure theory.  We may now consider in what ways it can be
applied to our individual lives.</p>
<p>We have just made it clear that true happiness is a happiness of growth
— and, as such, it awaits us in a quarter characterized by:</p>
<ol>
<li>unification of self within our own selves;</li>
<li>union of our own being with other beings who are our equals;</li>
<li>subordination of our own life to a life which is greater than ours.</li>
</ol>
<p>What consequences do these definitions entail for our day-to-day
conduct?  And what practical action should we take in order to be happy?</p>
<p>I can, of course, satisfy your curiosity and assist your good will by
only the most general indications; for it is here that, quite rightly,
we come up against any number of problems of taste, accident and
temperament.  Life becomes established and progresses in nature and
structure only by reason of the very great variety of its elements.
Each one of us sees the world and makes his approach to it from a
particular angle, backed by a reserve of vital energy, with its own
peculiarities, which cannot be shared by others.  (We may note,
incidentally, that it is this complementary diversity which underlies
the biological value of &lsquo;personality&rsquo;.)  Each of us, therefore, is the
only person who can ultimately discover for himself the attitude, the
approach (which nobody else can imitate), which will make him cohere to
the utmost possible degree with the surrounding universe as it continues
its progress; that cohesion being, in fact, a state of peace which
brings happiness.</p>
<p>Bearing these reservations in mind, we can, following our earlier lines
of thought, draw up the following three rules of happiness.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If we are to be happy, we must first react against our tendency to
follow the line of least resistance, which causes us either to remain
as we are, or to look primarily to activities external to ourselves
for what will provide new impetus to our lives.  We must, it is true,
sink our roots deep into the rich, tangible, material realities which
surround us; but in the end it is by working to achieve our own inner
perfection — intellectual, artistic, moral — that we shall find
happiness.  The most important thing in life, Nansen used to say, is
to find oneself.  Through and beyond matter, spirit is hard at work,
building.  — <em>Centration.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we are to be happy we must, secondly, react against the
selfishness which causes us either to close in on ourselves, or to
force our domination upon others.  There is a way of loving — a bad
and sterile way — by which we try to possess rather than to give
ourselves.  Here again, in the case of the couple or the group, we
meet that same law of maximum effort which governed the progress of
our interior development.  The only love which brings true happiness
is that which is expressed in a spiritual progress effected in
common.  — <em>Decentration.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And if we are to be happy — completely happy — we must, thirdly, in
one way or another, directly or through some medium which gradually
reaches out further afield (a line of research, a venture, an idea,
perhaps, or a cause), transfer the ultimate interest of our lives to
the advancement and success of the world we live in.  If we are to
reach the zone where the great permanent sources of joy are to be
found, we must be like the Curies, like Termier and Nansen, like the
first aviators and all the pioneers I spoke of earlier: we must
re-polarize our lives upon one greater than ourselves.  Do not be
afraid that this means that if we are to be happy we must perform
some remarkable feat or do something quite out of the ordinary; we
have only to do what any one of us is capable of: become conscious of
our living solidarity with the great Thing, and then do the smallest
thing in a great way.  We must add one stitch, no matter how small it
be, to the magnificent tapestry of life; we must discern the Immense
which is building up and whose magnetic pull is exerted at the very
heart of our own humblest activities and at their term; we must
discern it and cling to it — when all is said and done, that is the
great secret of happiness.  As one of the most acute, and most
materialist, thinkers of modern England, Bertrand Russell, has put
it: it is in a deep and instinctive union with the whole current of
life that the greatest of all joys is to be found.  —
<em>Super-centration.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There you have the real core of what I have to say to you; but, having
reached that point, there is one more thing which I owe it to you and to
myself to say, if I am to be absolutely truthful.</p>
<p>I was recently reading a curious book (H. G. Wells, The Anatomy of
Frustration), in which the English novelist and thinker H. G. Wells
writes about the original views recorded earlier by an American
biologist and businessman, William Burrough Steele, which bear precisely
on the point we are now considering, human happiness. Steele tries, with
much good sense and cogency, to show (just as I have been doing) that
since happiness cannot be dissociated from some notion of immortality,
man cannot hope to be fully happy unless he sinks his own interests and
hopes in those of the world, and more particularly in those of mankind.
He adds, however, that, put in those terms, the solution is still
incomplete; for if we are to be able to make a complete gift of self we
must be able to love.  And how can one love a collective, impersonal
reality — a reality that in some respects must seem monstrous — such as
the world, or even mankind?</p>
<p>The objection which Steele found when he looked deeper, and to which
he gave no answer, is terribly and cruelly to the point.  My treatment
of the subject would, therefore, be both incomplete and disingenuous if
I did not point out to you that the undeniable movement which, as we can
see, is leading the mass of mankind to place itself at the service of
progress is not &lsquo;self-sufficient&rsquo;: if this terrestrial drive which I am
asking you to share is to be sustained, it must be harmonized and
synthesized with the Christian drive.</p>
<p>We can look around and note how the mysticism of research and the social
mysticisms are advancing, with admirable faith, towards the conquest of
the future.  Yet no clearly defined summit, and, what is more serious,
no lovable object is there for them to worship.  That is the basic
reason why the enthusiasm and the devotion they arouse are hard, arid,
cold, and sad; to an observer they can only be a cause for anxiety, and
to those who aspire to them they can bring only an incomplete happiness.</p>
<p>At the same time, parallel with these human mysticisms, and until now
only marginal to them, there is Christian mysticism; and for the last
two thousand years this has constantly been developing more profoundly
(though few realize this) its view of a personal God: a God who not only
creates but animates and gives totality to a universe which he gathers
to himself by means of all those forces which we group together under
the name of evolution.  Under the persistent pressure of Christian
thought, the infinitely distressing vastness of the world is gradually
converging upwards, to the point were it is transfigured into a focus of
loving energy.</p>
<p>Surely, then, we cannot fail to see that these two powerful currents
between which the force of man&rsquo;s religious energies is divided — the
current of human progress, and the current of all embracing charity —
need but one thing, to run together, and complete one another?</p>
<p>Suppose, first, that the youthful surge of human aspirations,
fantastically reinforced by our new concepts of time and space, of
matter and life, should make its way into the life-stream of
Christianity, enriching and invigorating it; and suppose at the same
time, too, that the wholly modern figure of a universal Christ, such as
is even now being developed by Christian consciousness, should stand,
should burst into sight, should spread its radiance, at the peak of our
dreams of progress, and so give them precision, humanize and personalize
them.  Would not this be an answer, or rather <em>the</em> complete answer, to
the difficulties before which our action hesitates?</p>
<p>Unless it receives a new blood transfusion from matter, Christian
spirituality may well lose its vigor and become lost in the clouds.
And, even more certainly, unless man&rsquo;s sense of progress receives an
infusion from some principle of universal love, it may well turn away
with horror from the terrifying cosmic machine in which it finds itself
involved.</p>
<p>If we join the head to the body — the base to the peak — then, suddenly,
there comes a surge of plenitude.</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, I see the complete solution to the problem of
happiness in the direction of a Christian humanism: or, if you prefer
the phrase, in the direction of a super-human Christianity within which
every man will one day understand that, at all times and in all
circumstances, it is possible for him not only to serve (for serving is
not enough) but to cherish in all things (the most forbidding and
tedious, no less than the loveliest and most attractive) a universe
which, in its evolution, is charged with love.</p>
