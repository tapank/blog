			<h1>Reaching Long Term Goals</h1>

				<p>Reaching a goal or successfully executing a plan — one thing they have in
common is that they need us to make progress.  Our rate of success in
reaching the short term goals is a good indicator of whether we will
succeed at long term goals. This is because the one thing we need to do for
the short term goal — make progress in the present — is also applicable
to longer term goals but with an amplified effect on the outcome.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-fail">Why we fail</h2>
<p>Alas, we are not very good at making progress <em>now</em>. We think we could have
made progress in the past. We think we can definitely make progress in the
future. But we fail at making progress here and now. We are optimistic when
setting a goal. In the excitement of thinking about a positive future, we
believe we can do more than our track record would indicate. This is why we
come up with lofty new year goals only to be disappointed by our inability
to follow through with our plans.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-succeed">How to succeed</h2>
<p>If we are not reaching our short term goals, it is unlikely that we will
reach the long term goals. We should first fix this by improving our
success rate of reaching short term goals. This helps us get quick
feedback and allows us to test out strategies that do and do not work for
us. We can play with the two knobs that we control:</p>
<ol>
<li>our ability to finish the planned tasks of the day; and</li>
<li>setting realistic goals</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-daily-tasks">The daily tasks</h3>
<p>At the end of the day, when we plan the tasks for the next day, we are
optimistic. We tend to trust our future self to do things that our current
self may be unwilling to take on. Yet, we go ahead and plan the tasks for
tomorrow with the assumption that when the time comes, we will be up for
the tasks. When we see ourselves
constantly fall short on this metric, the first thing to do is improve the
day to day success rate of completed tasks, whatever they may be. This is
how we train ourselves to actually do those things that we said we will do.
This is a muscle that can and must be trained.  Every little success here
creates a positive feedback loop, and it further improves our success rate
of reaching short term goals.</p>
<h3 id="be-realistic">Be realistic</h3>
<p>While training our ability to complete the daily tasks, we should pay close
attention to how we feel as the days go by. It is possible to power through
our daily tasks for a few days and create a high success rate but if we
feel worse with each passing day, that pace is unsustainable. The pace
improves with time, but the optimal pace is highly individual and hence we
must be careful to not compare ourselves to others.  Once we hit a
sustainable pace, we can use that as an input when we plan for the long
term goals.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While we are still failing to reach our short term goals, let us not assume
we will magically succeed in our long term goals. We should first train to
get better at reaching our short term goals.  This not only gives us a
realistic assessment of our current abilities, but when done frequently, it
also improves our abilities. This is the path to reaching our long term
goals.</p>
