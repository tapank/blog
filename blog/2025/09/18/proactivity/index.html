				<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>, the first
habit from the group &ldquo;Private Victory&rdquo; is &ldquo;Be Proactive.&rdquo;  Covey defines
proactivity so well that the answer to the question of how to be
proactive is almost self evident.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By nature, humans are proactive.  If our lives are a function of
conditioning and conditions, it is because we have, by conscious
decision or by default, chosen to empower those things to control us.
In making such a choice, we become reactive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment.  If
the weather is good, they feel good.  If it isn&rsquo;t, it affects their
attitude and their performance.  Proactive people can carry their own
weather with them.  Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to
them.  They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good
quality work, it isn&rsquo;t a function of whether the weather is conducive
to it or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reactive people are also affected by their social environment, by the
&ldquo;social weather.&rdquo;  When people treat them well, they feel well; when
people don&rsquo;t, they become defensive or protective.  Reactive people
build their emotional lives around the behavior of others, empowering
the weaknesses of other people to control them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the
proactive person.  Reactive people are driven by feelings, by
circumstances, by conditions, by their environment.  Proactive people
are driven by values—carefully thought about, selected and
internalized values.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether
physical, social, or psychological.  But their response to the
stimuli, conscious or unconscious, is a value-based choice or
response.</p>
