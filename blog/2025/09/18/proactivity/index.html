				<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People">The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</a>, the first
habit from the group &ldquo;Private Victory&rdquo; is &ldquo;Be Proactive.&rdquo;  Covey defines
proactivity so well that the answer to the question of how to be
proactive is almost self evident.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By nature, humans are proactive.  If our lives are a function of
conditioning and conditions, it is because we have, by conscious
decision or by default, chosen to empower those things to control us.
In making such a choice, we become reactive.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reactive people are often affected by their physical environment.  If
the weather is good, they feel good.  If it isn&rsquo;t, it affects their
attitude and their performance.  Proactive people can carry their own
weather with them.  Whether it rains or shines makes no difference to
them.  They are value driven; and if their value is to produce good
quality work, it isn&rsquo;t a function of whether the weather is conducive
to it or not.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reactive people are also affected by their social environment, by the
&ldquo;social weather.&rdquo;  When people treat them well, they feel well; when
people don&rsquo;t, they become defensive or protective.  Reactive people
build their emotional lives around the behavior of others, empowering
the weaknesses of other people to control them.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the
proactive person.  Reactive people are driven by feelings, by
circumstances, by conditions, by their environment.  Proactive people
are driven by valuesâ€”carefully thought about, selected and
internalized values.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Proactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether
physical, social, or psychological.  But their response to the
stimuli, conscious or unconscious, is a value-based choice or
response.</p></blockquote>
