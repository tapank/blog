			<h1>Retirement</h1>

				<p>It&rsquo;s been over a year since I quit my job.  I think the technical term
for it is &ldquo;retirement,&rdquo; but for a long time, I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to
use that word. Stepping away from the regular grind was what I wanted,
but actually accepting that my working life was over?  That took a
surprising amount of time to sink in.  You can call it quits on paper,
but it takes a while for your mind to catch up to the reality of a
completely new identity.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve spent decades working, your entire routine is built around
that job.  So, what I didn&rsquo;t quite anticipate was how hard it would be
to figure out how to fill the time.  Honestly, I&rsquo;m still struggling with
this.  It&rsquo;s a strange feeling, having total freedom but not having a
ready-made structure to put it into.  It turns out that having endless
free time can be just as demanding as having none at all!  It hasn&rsquo;t all
been a struggle, though.  I&rsquo;ve been able to focus a lot more on my
health and fitness, which is a huge win.  But it&rsquo;s an ongoing project,
just like everything else.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m ready for the next phase. I&rsquo;ve realized that I still need
something that keeps my mind sharp.  I&rsquo;m actively looking for a way to
be creatively engaged, but here&rsquo;s the key difference: I want the
engagement without the stress of a typical job.  No deadlines, no office
politics, just a project that I genuinely enjoy sinking my teeth into.</p>
<p>This new life is still a work in progress, and I&rsquo;m excited about
exploring this next chapter, figuring out what makes me tick now, and
building a schedule that&rsquo;s truly my own.</p>
