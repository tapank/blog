<p>Author: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Bennett">Arnold Bennett</a><br>
Reviewed on: 07 September 2024</p>
<p>This one is more of my book reading notes than a review.  I hope these notes
will rouse enough curiosity in you to actually go read the book.</p>
<ul>
<li>Majority of the men put not as much but as little of themselves as they
conscientiously can into the earning of a livelihood, and that their vocation
bores rather than interests them.</li>
<li>It is always the man who has tasted life who demands more of it.  And it is
always the man who never gets out of bed who is the most difficult to rouse.</li>
<li>A man&rsquo;s powers ought not to be monopolized by his ordinary day&rsquo;s work.  What,
then, is to be done?</li>
<li>Sleep is partly a matter of habit — and of slackness.  The author is convinced
that most people sleep as long as they do because they are at a loss for any
other diversion.</li>
<li>Time is the inexplicable raw material of everything.  With it, all is
possible; without it, nothing.</li>
<li>Money is far more commoner than time.  The supply of time, though gloriously
regular, is cruelly restricted.</li>
<li>We are haunted by the feeling that the years slip by, and slip by, and slip
by, and that we have not yet been able to get our lives into proper working
order.  That feeling of uneasiness, of expectation, of looking forward, of
aspiration.  It is a source of constant discomfort, for it behaves like a
skeleton at the fest of all our enjoyments.</li>
<li>You never will have &ldquo;more time,&rdquo; since you already have all the time there is.</li>
<li>The most important preliminary to the task of arranging one&rsquo;s life so that one
may live fully and comfortably within one&rsquo;s budget of twenty-four hours is the
calm realization of the extreme difficulty of the task, of the sacrifices and
the endless effort which it demands.</li>
<li>If you will not be content with a small result for a big effort, then do not
begin.</li>
<li>There is no magic method of beginning.  If a man standing on the edge of a
swimming-bath and wanting to jump into the cold water should ask you, &ldquo;How do
I begin to jump?&rdquo; you would merely reply, &ldquo;Just jump.  Take hold of your
nerves, and jump.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The beauty about the constant supply of time is that you cannot waste it in
advance.</li>
<li>You may fancy that the water will be warmer next week.  It won&rsquo;t.  It will be
colder.</li>
<li>Let me principally warn you against your own ardor.  Ardor in well-doing is a
misleading and a treacherous thing.  It cries out loudly for employment; you
can&rsquo;t satisfy it at first; it wants more and more; it is eager to move
mountains and divert the course of rivers.  It isn&rsquo;t content till it
perspires.  And then, too often, when it feels the perspiration on its brow,
it wearies all of a sudden and dies, without even putting itself to the
trouble of saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of this.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Beware of undertaking too much at the start.  Be content with quite a little.
Allow for accidents.  Allow for human nature, especially your own.</li>
<li>Just as nothing succeeds like success, so nothing fails like failure.  Most
people who are ruined are ruined by attempting too much.  A glorious failure
leads to nothing; a petty success may lead to a success that is not petty.</li>
<li>The great and profound mistake which a typical man makes in regard to his day
is a mistake of general attitude, a mistake which vitiates and weakens
two-thirds of his energies and interests.  In the majority of instances he
does not precisely feel a passion for his business; at best he does not
dislike it.  He begins his business functions with reluctance, as late as he
can, and he ends them with joy, as early as he can.  And his engines while he
is engaged in his business are seldom at their full &ldquo;h.p.&rdquo;  Yet in spite of
all this he persists in looking upon those hours from ten to six as &ldquo;the day,&rdquo;
to which the ten hours preceding them and the six hours following them are
nothing but a prologue and epilogue.  Such an attitude, unconscious though it
be, of course kills his interest in the odd sixteen hours, with the result
that, even if he does not waste them, he does not count them; he regards them
simply as margin.  This general attitude is utterly illogical and unhealthy,
since it formally gives the central prominence to a patch of time and a bunch
of activities which the man&rsquo;s one idea is to &ldquo;get through&rdquo; and have &ldquo;done
with.&rdquo;  If a man makes two-thirds of his existence subservient to one-third,
for which admittedly he has no absolutely feverish zest, how can he hope to
live fully and completely?  He cannot.</li>
<li>One of the chief things which a typical man has to learn is that the mental
faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an
arm or a leg.  All they want is change—not rest, except in sleep.</li>
<li>Newspapers are produced with rapidity, to be read with rapidity.  There is no
place in my daily program for newspapers.  I read them as I may in odd
moments.  But I do read them.  The idea of devoting to them thirty or forty
consecutive minutes of time is to me repugnant.  I cannot possibly allow you
to scatter priceless pearls of time with such Oriental lavishness.  You are
not the Shah of time.  Let me respectfully remind you that you have no more
time than I have.</li>
<li>I suggest that at six o&rsquo;clock (after work), you look facts in the face and
admit that you are not tired (because you are not, you know), and that you
arrange your evening so that it is not cut in the middle by a meal.  By so
doing you will have a clear expanse of at least three hours.  Employ them in
some important and consecutive cultivation of the mind.</li>
<li>The man who begins to go to bed forty minutes before he opens his bedroom
door is bored; that is to say, he is not living.</li>
<li>Habits are the very dickens to change!  Any change, even a change for the
better, is always accompanied by drawbacks and discomforts.  If you imagine
that you will be able to devote a few hours a day to serious, continuous
effort, and still live your old life, you are mistaken.  I repeat that some
sacrifice, and an immense deal of volition, will be necessary.  And it is
because I know the difficulty, it is because I know the almost disastrous
effect of failure in such an enterprise, that I earnestly advise a very humble
beginning.  You must safeguard your self-respect.  Self-respect is at the root
of all purposefulness, and a failure in an enterprise deliberately planned
deals a desperate wound at one&rsquo;s self-respect.  Hence I iterate and reiterate:
Start quietly, unostentatiously.</li>
<li>When you have conscientiously given seven hours and a half a week to the
cultivation of your vitality for three months—then you may begin to sing
louder and tell yourself what wondrous things you are capable of doing.</li>
<li>Before coming to the method of using the indicated hours, I have one final
suggestion to make.  That is, as regards the evenings, to allow much more than
an hour and a half in which to do the work of an hour and a half.  Remember
the chance of accidents.  Remember human nature.  And give yourself, say, from
9 to 11.30 for your task of ninety minutes.</li>
<li>People complain of the lack of power to concentrate, not witting that they may
acquire the power, if they choose.  Without the power to concentrate—that is
to say, without the power to dictate to the brain its task and to ensure
obedience—true life is impossible.  Mind control is the first element of a
full existence.</li>
<li>Why not devote a little attention to the far more delicate machinery of the
mind, especially as you will require no extraneous aid?  It is for this
portion of the art and craft of living that I have reserved the time of the
morning run.</li>
<li>I do not care what you concentrate on, so long as you concentrate.  It is the
mere disciplining of the thinking machine that counts.  But still, you may as
well kill two birds with one stone, and concentrate on something useful.  I
suggest — it is only a suggestion — a little chapter of Marcus Aurelius or
Epictetus, Bhagwat Geeta, or Patanjali Yog Sutra.</li>
<li>I am entirely convinced that what is more than anything else lacking in the
life of the average well-intentioned man of today is the reflective mood.  We
do not reflect.  I mean that we do not reflect upon genuinely important
things; upon the problem of our happiness, upon the main direction in which we
are going, upon what life is giving to us, upon the share which reason has (or
has not) in determining our actions, and upon the relation between our
principles and our conduct.</li>
<li>The chances are that you have already come to believe that happiness is
unattainable.  But men have attained it.  And they have attained it by
realizing that happiness does not spring from the procuring of physical or
mental pleasure, but from the development of reason and the adjustment of
conduct to principles.</li>
<li>The solitude of the evening walk can be used to reflect upon the day&rsquo;s living.
This is the time of a steady looking at one&rsquo;s self in the face (disconcerting
though the sight may be).  A reflective mood naturally follows the exertion of
having earned the day&rsquo;s living.</li>
<li>Nothing is humdrum.  The study of cause and effect, while it lessens the
painfulness of life, adds to life&rsquo;s picturesqueness.  The man to whom
evolution is but a name looks at the sea as a grandiose, monotonous spectacle,
which he can witness in August for three shillings third-class return.  The
man who is imbued with the idea of development, of continuous cause and
effect, perceives in the sea an element which in the day-before-yesterday of
geology was vapor, which yesterday was boiling, and which tomorrow will
inevitably be ice.  Nothing will afford a more durable satisfaction than the
constantly cultivated appreciation of this.  It is the end of all science.</li>
<li>In the cultivation of the mind one of the most important factors is precisely
the feeling of strain, of difficulty, of a task which one part of you is
anxious to achieve and another part of you is anxious to shirk; and that
feeling cannot be got in facing an easy task such as reading a novel.</li>
<li>I suggest no particular work as a start.  But I have two general suggestions
of a certain importance.  The first is to define the direction and scope of
your efforts.  Choose a limited period, or a limited subject, or a single
author.  Say to yourself: &ldquo;I will know something about the French Revolution,
or the rise of railways, or the works of John Keats.&rdquo; And during a given
period, to be settled beforehand, confine yourself to your choice.  There is
much pleasure to be derived from being a specialist.</li>
<li>The second suggestion is to think as well as to read.  I know people who read
and read, and for all the good it does them they might just as well cut
bread-and-butter.  They take to reading as better men take to drink.  They fly
through the shires of literature on a motor-car, their sole object being
motion.  They will tell you how many books they have read in a year.  Unless
you give at least forty-five minutes to careful, fatiguing reflection (it is
an awful bore at first) upon what you are reading, your ninety minutes of a
night are chiefly wasted.  This means that your pace will be slow.  Never
mind.  Forget the goal; think only of the surrounding country; and after a
period, perhaps when you least expect it, you will suddenly find yourself in a
lovely town on a hill.</li>
<li>When one sets forth on the enterprise of using all one&rsquo;s time, it is just as
well to remember that one&rsquo;s own time, and not other people&rsquo;s time, is the
material with which one has to deal; that the earth rolled on pretty
comfortably before one began to balance a budget of the hours, and that it
will continue to roll on pretty comfortably whether or not one succeeds in
one&rsquo;s new role of chancellor of the exchequer of time.  It is as well not to
chatter too much about what one is doing, and not to betray a too-pained
sadness at the spectacle of a whole world deliberately wasting so many hours
out of every day, and therefore never really living.  It will be found,
ultimately, that in taking care of one&rsquo;s self one has quite all one can do.</li>
<li>Another danger is the danger of being tied to a program like a slave to a
chariot.  One&rsquo;s program must not be allowed to run away with one.  It must be
respected, but it must not be worshiped as a fetish.  A program of daily
employ is not a religion.</li>
<li>And still another danger is the danger of developing a policy of rush, of
being gradually more and more obsessed by what one has to do next.  In this
way one may come to exist as in a prison, and one&rsquo;s life may cease to be one&rsquo;s
own.  One may take the dog out for a walk at eight o&rsquo;clock, and meditate the
whole time on the fact that one must begin to read at a quarter to nine, and
that one must not be late.</li>
<li>And the occasional deliberate breaking of one&rsquo;s program will not help to mend
matters.  The evil springs not from persisting without elasticity in what one
has attempted, but from originally attempting too much, from filling one&rsquo;s
program till it runs over.  The only cure is to reconstitute the program, and
to attempt less.</li>
<li>If the program exhibits a tendency to be oppressive, and yet one wishes not to
modify it, an excellent palliative is to pass with exaggerated deliberation
from one portion of it to another; for example, to spend five minutes in
perfect mental quiescence between chaining up the St.  Bernard and opening the
book; in other words, to waste five minutes with the entire consciousness of
wasting them.</li>
<li>The last, and chiefest danger is the risk of a failure at the commencement of
the enterprise.  A failure at the commencement may easily kill outright the
newborn impulse towards a complete vitality, and therefore every precaution
should be observed to avoid it.  The impulse must not be over-taxed.  Let the
pace of the first lap be even absurdly slow, but let it be as regular as
possible.  Having once decided to achieve a certain task, achieve it at all
costs of tedium and distaste.  The gain in self-confidence of having
accomplished a tiresome labor is immense.</li>
<li>Finally, in choosing the first occupations of those evening hours, be guided
by nothing whatever but your taste and natural inclination.  It is a fine
thing to be a walking encyclopedia of philosophy, but if you happen to have no
liking for philosophy, and to have a like for the natural history of
street-cries, much better leave philosophy alone, and take to street-cries.</li>

Reviewed on: 05 March 2024</p>
<p>William James was a philosopher who has written many books and essays.
Habit is one of his essays and is available as a book which can be download
for free from Google Books or archive.org since the copyright is expired.
The book was written more than 100 years ago and is short and stays on
point.  The author talks about his mental model about habit — how it is
formed, why is it difficult to form or break one, etc. He also explains why
habits are more physical than just psychological in the sense that they are
like grooves that guide our behavior subconsciously and this is what makes
it hard to change them.</p>
<p>The best part of the book is that it does not beat around the bush and gets
to the point right from the first sentence, which is: &ldquo;When we look at
living creatures from an outward point of view, one of the first things
that strike us is that they are bundles of habits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I started reading this book and could not go past the first couple of
chapters. I tried to pick it up again, but could not continue. Since I have
heard good things about this book, I was expecting it to be gripping, but
the style is not to my taste. It contains too many of personal anecdotes
for the book to be useful, at least to me.</p>

<p>Authors:  Brian P. Moran, Michael Lennington<br>
Reviewed on: 06 February 2024</p>
<p>In this book, the authors teach a method that they claim has helped
companies, business people, sports people and others achieve great heights.
At the core, this book is about compressing a year into 12 weeks, which
allows us to accomplish in 3 months what we think is achievable in a year.
And, the chances of success is higher than the typical one year thinking.
Each day should be thought of as a compressed week, which is a mental trick
to help us stay on plan. The system is layered and at the bottom is the
long term vision. This is arrived at after deep contemplation and
visualization of the desired future. Next is the 3 year vision which is
based on the long term vision, and finally, the 12 week plan which is based
on the 3 year vision.  The vision helps us pull through patches of low
motivation. The system includes 3 principles and 5 tactics, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Principles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Accountability: A willingness to own actions and results, regardless of
circumstances</li>
<li>Commitment: A personal promise that you make to yourself</li>
<li>Greatness in the Moment: Each moment that you choose to do the things
that you need to do to be great</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tactics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vision: A clear picture of the future</li>
<li>Planning: Actions needed to achieve the vision</li>
<li>Process Control: Align daily actions with your plan</li>
<li>Measurement: Lead and lag indicators that provide feedback</li>
<li>Time Use: Using your time with clear intention</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this system should work better than simply relying on motivation to
accomplish goals.</p>

<p>Author: Scott H. Young<br>
Reviewed on: 21 January 2024</p>
<p>The author never went to MIT but wanted to learn the CS curriculum of MIT
and took up the challenge of teaching himself the entire course in one
year, and successfully completed it. He also learned new languages like
French and South Korean in three months each and was able to comfortably
talk to native speakers of these languages. This book is about developing
the ability to learn hard things in a short span of time. Since projects
can be vastly different, the author argues that the best way to learn
ultralearning is to internalize a set of guiding principles (and not a set
of fixed steps), and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metalearing: first draw a map</li>
<li>Focus: sharpen your knife</li>
<li>Directness: go straight ahead</li>
<li>Drill: attack your weakest point</li>
<li>Retrieval: Test to learn</li>
<li>Feedback: Don&rsquo;t dodge the punches</li>
<li>Retention: Don&rsquo;t fill a leaky bucket</li>
<li>Intuition: Dig deep before building up</li>
<li>Experimentation: Explore outside your comfort zone</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these principles are internalized, one can pick up a project of their
choice, whether it is learning a new programming language, learning
carpentry, learning to play chess etc. and learn that skill in a short
time. This can be done at work to learn new skills or outside of work for
hobbies. Useful for students and professionals alike. I read the book
quickly in two days, and will now give it another pass at a slow and
deliberate speed.</p>

Reviewed on: 16 January 2024</p>
<p>The Courage to Be Disliked is about unlocking the power within yourself to
be the person you truly want to be. It is based on the theories of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler">Alfred
Adler</a>&rsquo;s Individual Psychology and is written as a conversation
between a philosopher and a young man. While reading this book, I was
constantly reminded of Bhagwad Geeta&rsquo;s message about removing attachment.
The book is written at a level that would work well for people in the late
teens as well as for adults of any age. The lessons can be summarized as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have
no bearing at all on how you live from now on.</li>
<li>All problems are interpersonal relationship problems.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not what one is born with but what use one makes of that equipment.</li>
<li>Deny the desire for recognition. It makes you unfree.</li>
<li>Do not live to satisfy the expectations of others.</li>
<li>Do not intervene in other people&rsquo;s tasks and do not allow other people to
intervene in your tasks.</li>
<li>You are not the center of the world.</li>
<li>Listen to the voice of the larger community. We belong to the community
of universe.</li>
<li>Do not rebuke or praise. Encourage.</li>
<li>Remain in the present. Here and now.</li>
<li>Excessive self-consciousness stifles the self. Don&rsquo;t affirm, but accept
the self. Have confidence in others.</li>
<li>If one has a feeling of contribution, one will no longer have any need for
recognition from others.</li>
<li>Community feeling: engage in self-acceptance, confidence in others, and
contribution to others.</li>
<li>Possess the courage to be normal, and your looking at the world will
change dramatically.</li>
<li>To shine a spotlight on here and now is to go about doing what one can do
now, earnestly and conscientiously.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above bullet points are cherry picked from the book in the hope that
going through these points will help me recall the message of the book. But
I realize that this is not a one-read book and needs to be read again and
again in order to internalize the message.</p>

Reviewed: 6 January 2024</p>
<p>Over the years, I would stumble upon claims that caffeine and/or coffee
have downsides which are underplayed by the media because of all the
marketing money the interested corporations throw at spinning positive
research about the benefits of coffee/caffeine. However, as some of those
claims started to resonate with my personal experience, I wanted to learn
more. I ended up reading this book because many coffee quitters pointed at
this book as a good place to get all the information. The book is a good
read and it deals with multiple aspects of caffeine harm from personal to
political and environmental. This book convinced me to finally quit coffee,
and the following summary of the book is what helped me make this call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caffeine can&rsquo;t provide energy, only chemical stimulation, an induced
emergency state that can lead to irritability, mood swings, and panic
attacks.</li>
<li>Caffeine&rsquo;s ultimate mood effect can be letdown, which can lead to
depression and chronic fatigue.</li>
<li>Caffeine gives the illusion of heightened alertness by dilating pupils,
quickening heart rate, and raising blood pressure. In fact caffeine does
not increase overall mental activity.</li>

<p>Author: Ian Bogost<br>
Reviewed: 3 January 2024</p>
<p>This book is about developing an attitude of play in anything we do. The
goal is to make our tasks and projects more engaging and fun, i.e. more
fulfilling and rewarding as opposed to being pleasurable. The following
two quotes from the book capture the message quite well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Misery gives way to fun when you take an object , event, situation, or
scenario that wasn&rsquo;t designed for you, that isn&rsquo;t concerned in the
slightest for your experience of it, and then <em>treat it as if it were</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is more productive to work with objects, people, and situations we
encounter by using, understanding, and appreciating them for what they
are rather than for how they make us feel about ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It became harder to proceed with the book after a couple of chapters, and
the reviews on Goodreads echo this too. I eventually skimmed through the
rest of the book and called it done. However, the core message is really
compelling and worth adopting in terms of our general attitude towards
things.</p>
