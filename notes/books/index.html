<p>Author: Stephen Cherniske<br>

<p>Over the years, I would stumble upon claims that caffeine and/or coffee
have downsides which are underplayed by the media because of all the
marketing money the interested corporations throw at spinning positive
research about the benefits of coffee/caffeine. However, as some of those
claims started to resonate with my personal experience, I wanted to learn
more. I ended up reading this book because many coffee quitters pointed at
this book as a good place to get all the information. The book is a good
read and it deals with multiple aspects of caffeine harm from personal to
political and environmental. This book convinced me to finally quit coffee,
and the following summary of the book is what helped me make this call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caffeine can&rsquo;t provide energy, only chemical stimulation, an induced
emergency state that can lead to irritability, mood swings, and panic
attacks.</li>
<li>Caffeine&rsquo;s ultimate mood effect can be letdown, which can lead to
depression and chronic fatigue.</li>
<li>Caffeine gives the illusion of heightened alertness by dilating pupils,
quickening heart rate, and raising blood pressure. In fact caffeine does
not increase overall mental activity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="play-anything-the-pleasure-of-limits-the-uses-of-boredom-and-the-secret-of-games">Play Anything: The Pleasure of Limits, the Uses of Boredom, and the Secret of Games</h2>
<p>Author: Ian Bogost<br>
Reviewed: 3 January 2024</p>
<p>This book is about developing an attitude of play in anything we do. The
goal is to make our tasks and projects more engaging and fun, i.e. more
fulfilling and rewarding as opposed to being pleasurable. The following
two quotes from the book capture the message quite well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Misery gives way to fun when you take an object , event, situation, or
scenario that wasn&rsquo;t designed for you, that isn&rsquo;t concerned in the
slightest for your experience of it, and then <em>treat it as if it were</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is more productive to work with objects, people, and situations we
encounter by using, understanding, and appreciating them for what they
are rather than for how they make us feel about ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It became harder to proceed with the book after a couple of chapters, and
the reviews on Goodreads echo this too. I eventually skimmed through the
rest of the book and called it done. However, the core message is really
compelling and worth adopting in terms of our general attitude towards
things.</p>
