				<p>A personal summary of books I have ready and/or am reading. I started doing
this in the beginning of 2024. I may later add some books that I read prior.</p>

<h2 id="habit">Habit</h2>
<p>Author: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James">William James</a><br>
Reviewed on: 05 March 2024</p>
<p>William James was a philosopher who has written many books and essays.
Habit is one of his essays and is available as a book which can be download
for free from Google Books or archive.org since the copyright is expired.
The book was written more than 100 years ago and is short and stays on
point.  The author talks about his mental model about habit â€” how it is
formed, why is it difficult to form or break one, etc. He also explains why
habits are more physical than just psychological in the sense that they are
like grooves that guide our behavior subconsciously and this is what makes
it hard to change them.</p>
<p>The best part of the book is that it does not beat around the bush and gets
to the point right from the first sentence, which is: &ldquo;When we look at
living creatures from an outward point of view, one of the first things
that strike us is that they are bundles of habits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I abandoned readying this book after a couple of chapters.</p>
<p>I started reading this book and could not go past the first couple of
chapters. I tried to pick it up again, but could not continue. Since I have
heard good things about this book, I was expecting it to be gripping, but
the style is not to my taste. It contains too many of personal anecdotes
for the book to be useful, at least to me.</p>

<h3 id="get-more-done-in-12-weeks-than-others-do-in-12-months">Get More Done in 12 Weeks Than Others Do in 12 Months</h3>
<p>Authors:  Brian P. Moran, Michael Lennington<br>
Reviewed on: 06 February 2024</p>
<p>In this book, the authors teach a method that they claim has helped
companies, business people, sports people and others achieve great heights.
At the core, this book is about compressing a year into 12 weeks, which
allows us to accomplish in 3 months what we think is achievable in a year.
And, the chances of success is higher than the typical one year thinking.
Each day should be thought of as a compressed week, which is a mental trick
to help us stay on plan. The system is layered and at the bottom is the
long term vision. This is arrived at after deep contemplation and
visualization of the desired future. Next is the 3 year vision which is
based on the long term vision, and finally, the 12 week plan which is based
on the 3 year vision.  The vision helps us pull through patches of low
motivation. The system includes 3 principles and 5 tactics, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Principles</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Accountability: A willingness to own actions and results, regardless of
circumstances</li>
<li>Commitment: A personal promise that you make to yourself</li>
<li>Greatness in the Moment: Each moment that you choose to do the things
that you need to do to be great</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tactics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vision: A clear picture of the future</li>
<li>Planning: Actions needed to achieve the vision</li>
<li>Process Control: Align daily actions with your plan</li>
<li>Measurement: Lead and lag indicators that provide feedback</li>
<li>Time Use: Using your time with clear intention</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this system should work better than simply relying on motivation to
accomplish goals.</p>

<h2 id="ultralearning">Ultralearning</h2>
<h3 id="master-hard-skills-outsmart-the-competition-and-accelerate-your-career">Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate your career</h3>
<p>Author: Scott H. Young<br>
Reviewed on: 21 January 2024</p>
<p>The author never went to MIT but wanted to learn the CS curriculum of MIT
and took up the challenge of teaching himself the entire course in one
year, and successfully completed it. He also learned new languages like
French and South Korean in three months each and was able to comfortably
talk to native speakers of these languages. This book is about developing
the ability to learn hard things in a short span of time. Since projects
can be vastly different, the author argues that the best way to learn
ultralearning is to internalize a set of guiding principles (and not a set
of fixed steps), and those are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metalearing: first draw a map</li>
<li>Focus: sharpen your knife</li>
<li>Directness: go straight ahead</li>
<li>Drill: attack your weakest point</li>
<li>Retrieval: Test to learn</li>
<li>Feedback: Don&rsquo;t dodge the punches</li>
<li>Retention: Don&rsquo;t fill a leaky bucket</li>
<li>Intuition: Dig deep before building up</li>
<li>Experimentation: Explore outside your comfort zone</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these principles are internalized, one can pick up a project of their
choice, whether it is learning a new programming language, learning
carpentry, learning to play chess etc. and learn that skill in a short
time. This can be done at work to learn new skills or outside of work for
hobbies. Useful for students and professionals alike. I read the book
quickly in two days, and will now give it another pass at a slow and
deliberate speed.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-free-yourself-change-your-life-and-achieve-real-happiness">How to Free Yourself, Change your Life and Achieve Real Happiness</h3>
<p>Authors: Ichiro Kishimi &amp; Fumitake Koga<br>
Reviewed on: 16 January 2024</p>
<p>The Courage to Be Disliked is about unlocking the power within yourself to
be the person you truly want to be. It is based on the theories of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler">Alfred
Adler</a>&rsquo;s Individual Psychology and is written as a conversation
between a philosopher and a young man. While reading this book, I was
constantly reminded of Bhagwad Geeta&rsquo;s message about removing attachment.
The book is written at a level that would work well for people in the late
teens as well as for adults of any age. The lessons can be summarized as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have
no bearing at all on how you live from now on.</li>
<li>All problems are interpersonal relationship problems.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not what one is born with but what use one makes of that equipment.</li>
<li>Deny the desire for recognition. It makes you unfree.</li>
<li>Do not live to satisfy the expectations of others.</li>
<li>Do not intervene in other people&rsquo;s tasks and do not allow other people to
intervene in your tasks.</li>
<li>You are not the center of the world.</li>
<li>Listen to the voice of the larger community. We belong to the community
of universe.</li>
<li>Do not rebuke or praise. Encourage.</li>
<li>Remain in the present. Here and now.</li>
<li>Excessive self-consciousness stifles the self. Don&rsquo;t affirm, but accept
the self. Have confidence in others.</li>
<li>If one has a feeling of contribution, one will no longer have any need for
recognition from others.</li>
<li>Community feeling: engage in self-acceptance, confidence in others, and
contribution to others.</li>
<li>Possess the courage to be normal, and your looking at the world will
change dramatically.</li>
<li>To shine a spotlight on here and now is to go about doing what one can do
now, earnestly and conscientiously.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above bullet points are cherry picked from the book in the hope that
going through these points will help me recall the message of the book. But
I realize that this is not a one-read book and needs to be read again and
again in order to internalize the message.</p>

<h2 id="caffeine-blues">Caffeine Blues</h2>
<h3 id="waking-up-to-the-hidden-dangers-of-americas-1-drug">Waking up to the hidden dangers of America&rsquo;s #1 drug</h3>
<p>Author: Stephen Cherniske<br>
Reviewed: 6 January 2024</p>
<p>Over the years, I would stumble upon claims that caffeine and/or coffee
have downsides which are underplayed by the media because of all the
marketing money the interested corporations throw at spinning positive
research about the benefits of coffee/caffeine. However, as some of those
claims started to resonate with my personal experience, I wanted to learn
more. I ended up reading this book because many coffee quitters pointed at
this book as a good place to get all the information. The book is a good
read and it deals with multiple aspects of caffeine harm from personal to
political and environmental. This book convinced me to finally quit coffee,
and the following summary of the book is what helped me make this call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caffeine can&rsquo;t provide energy, only chemical stimulation, an induced
emergency state that can lead to irritability, mood swings, and panic
attacks.</li>
<li>Caffeine&rsquo;s ultimate mood effect can be letdown, which can lead to
depression and chronic fatigue.</li>
<li>Caffeine gives the illusion of heightened alertness by dilating pupils,
quickening heart rate, and raising blood pressure. In fact caffeine does
not increase overall mental activity.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-pleasure-of-limits-the-uses-of-boredom-and-the-secret-of-games">The Pleasure of Limits, the Uses of Boredom, and the Secret of Games</h3>
<p>Author: Ian Bogost<br>
Reviewed: 3 January 2024</p>
<p>This book is about developing an attitude of play in anything we do. The
goal is to make our tasks and projects more engaging and fun, i.e. more
fulfilling and rewarding as opposed to being pleasurable. The following
two quotes from the book capture the message quite well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Misery gives way to fun when you take an object , event, situation, or
scenario that wasn&rsquo;t designed for you, that isn&rsquo;t concerned in the
slightest for your experience of it, and then <em>treat it as if it were</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is more productive to work with objects, people, and situations we
encounter by using, understanding, and appreciating them for what they
are rather than for how they make us feel about ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It became harder to proceed with the book after a couple of chapters, and
the reviews on Goodreads echo this too. I eventually skimmed through the
rest of the book and called it done. However, the core message is really
compelling and worth adopting in terms of our general attitude towards
things.</p>
